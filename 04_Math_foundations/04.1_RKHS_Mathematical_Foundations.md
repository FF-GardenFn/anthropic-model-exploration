# RKHS Mathematical Foundations for Interpretable Attention Analysis

> Note on Scope: We outline a formalization of attention mechanisms through Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space theory as a candidate framework; applications remain subject to empirical validation.

## Abstract

This document provides the mathematical foundation for analyzing attention mechanisms through kernel ridge regression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Building from the philosophical insights developed in Section 03—particularly the need to transform cognitive opacity into mathematical transparency—we establish rigorous statistical frameworks for attention analysis.

The RKHS approach addresses the core interpretability challenge identified in our philosophical foundations: transforming opaque neural computations into mathematically structured operations with clear influence patterns, bounded interventions, and statistical validation protocols. This mathematical precision enables the testable predictions and implementation pathways that philosophy alone cannot provide.

## Morphemic Analysis Framework: Theoretical Foundation

### Core Hypothesis: Linguistic Structures as Mathematical Objects

**Theoretical Proposition**: We explore whether linguistic morphemes may correspond to mathematical singularities in interpolated semantic fields[^stat-method]:

| Linguistic Structure | Mathematical Object | Interpretability Gain |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Affixes** (un-, -ing, -ed) | **Poles with Residues** | Quantifiable semantic transformations |
| **Root Morphemes** (run, love, think) | **Branch Points** | Multi-valued semantic functions |
| **Compositional Meaning** | **Analytic Continuation** | Predictable semantic algebra |

### Theoretical Validation Framework

**Methodological Approach**: The morphemic analysis framework proposes to investigate:
- **Compositional Prediction**: Development of methods to predict semantic transformations through morphemic decomposition
- **Pattern Detection**: Identification of consistent mathematical structures across morphemic categories  
- **Complexity Analysis**: Theoretical pathway toward reduced-parameter representations through mathematical singularity analysis

**Research Direction**: This framework provides a mathematically principled bridge between discrete token computation and continuous semantic analysis. The potential welfare relevance of morphemic transformations motivates further investigation of safety applications[^1].

### Supporting Infrastructure: Attention Mechanisms and RKHS Foundation

**Mathematical Framework**: The theoretical foundation builds upon:
- **RKHS Correspondence**: Attention mechanisms can be analyzed through kernel ridge regression: $$\text{AC\_Attention} \equiv K(K + \lambda I)^{-1}$$
- **Statistical Methods**: Development of significance testing protocols for circuit analysis
- **Scalability Theory**: Mathematical frameworks designed for application to large-scale models[^2]

## 2.5 Empirical Validation Strategy

### Connection to Mechanistic Interpretability
The RKHS framework provides mathematical tools for understanding features discovered through mechanistic interpretability:
- Eigendecomposition of S reveals dominant computational modes
- GCV optimization provides principled regularization selection
- Hat matrix diagnostics quantify influence patterns

### Testable Predictions
1. **Spectral Concentration**: Attention patterns should show power-law eigenvalue decay
2. **Regularization Consistency**: Optimal λ should be consistent across similar tasks
3. **Influence Locality**: Hat matrix should show structured sparsity patterns

### Validation Protocol
1. Extract attention matrices from trained models
2. Compute RKHS operators and spectral properties
3. Compare predictions with observed behaviors
4. Validate against interpretability findings

## Theoretical Considerations and Assumptions

### Mathematical Principles of Morphemic Fields

**Holomorphic Constraint**: Semantic fields satisfy Cauchy-Riemann equations away from morphemic singularities:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$

**Symbol Definitions**:
- $u(x,y), v(x,y)$ = real and imaginary parts of semantic field $\psi(x+iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ = partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates

**Safety Consideration**: Mathematical constraints may help limit arbitrary semantic drift, potentially providing bounds on compositional behavior[^stat-method].

### Analytic Continuation Framework

**Compositional Predictability**: The morphemic algebra enables prediction:
$$\psi(\text{modified\_word}) = \psi(\text{base\_word}) + \sum_i \frac{\text{Res}(\text{pole}_i)}{z - z_{\text{pole}_i}}$$

**Symbol Definitions**:
- $\psi$ = semantic field in complex plane
- $\text{Res}(\text{pole}_i)$ = residue of morphemic pole $i$
- $z_{\text{pole}_i}$ = location of morphemic pole $i$
- $z$ = complex coordinate

**Welfare Consideration**: Morphemic composition patterns appear to exhibit mathematical constraints, suggesting potential applications for detecting harmful semantic constructions[^stat-method].

### Scalability Through Mathematical Structure

**Complexity Reduction**: Instead of analyzing millions of parameters:
- **~100 poles** (common affixes with quantifiable residues)
- **~10,000 branch points** (root morphemes with semantic sheets)
- **Continuous fields** (holomorphic between singularities)

**Production Potential**: Mathematical structure may scale to frontier models while supporting interpretability[^stat-method].

## RKHS and Attestation Fundamentals (Common Foundations)

This section centralizes the core linear‑algebraic machinery used throughout the research projects. For detailed statistical methodology and calibration procedures, see Appendix: Methodology for Statistical Significance and Validation[^stat-method].

For a head with queries and keys:
$$Q \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d_h}, \quad Z \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d_h}$$

**Symbol Definitions**:
- $Q$ = query matrix
- $Z$ = key matrix (using $Z$ to avoid confusion with kernel $K$)
- $T$ = sequence length
- $d_h$ = head dimension

Cross/Gram kernels:
$$K_{qk} = Q Z^\top, \quad K_{kk} = Z Z^\top$$

Influence (hat) matrices with ridge parameter $\lambda > 0$:
$$H_{qk}(\lambda) = K_{qk} (K_{kk} + \lambda I)^{-1}, \quad H_{kk}(\lambda) = K_{kk} (K_{kk} + \lambda I)^{-1}$$

**Symbol Definitions**:
- $K_{qk}$ = cross-kernel matrix
- $K_{kk}$ = Gram kernel matrix
- $H_{qk}, H_{kk}$ = hat matrices (influence operators)
- $\lambda$ = regularization parameter
- $I$ = identity matrix

Diagnostics (per head, per intent):
$$\mathrm{GCV}(\lambda) = \frac{\| (I - H_{kk})\,V \|_F^2}{\big(T - \mathrm{tr}\, H_{kk}\big)^2}$$

$$\mathrm{DoF} = \mathrm{tr}\, H_{kk} = \sum_i \frac{\sigma_i^2}{\sigma_i^2 + \lambda} \quad (Z = U \, \Sigma \, W^\top)$$

**Symbol Definitions**:
- $\mathrm{GCV}(\lambda)$ = Generalized Cross Validation score
- $\mathrm{DoF}$ = Degrees of Freedom
- $V$ = value matrix
- $\mathrm{tr}$ = trace operator
- $\sigma_i$ = singular values from SVD of $Z$
- $U, \Sigma, W$ = SVD components of $Z$

Symmetric resonance operator (PSD):
$$S = H_{qk} H_{kq}$$

**Symbol Definitions**:
- $S$ = symmetric resonance operator
- $H_{kq} = H_{qk}^T$ = transpose of cross hat matrix

Monitoring guidance:
- Track eigengap and spectral entropy; power iteration on $S$ to examine multi‑phase resonance.
- Stability signals: resonance concentration, leverage extremes, $\kappa(K_{kk} + \lambda I)$.

Policy guidance: thresholds on {$\mathrm{GCV}$, $\mathrm{DoF}$, eigengap, resonance concentration$}$ are set per‑task and validated empirically (see Appendix[^stat-method]).

Compute considerations: SVD/Woodbury on $d_h \times d_h$ (small), batched per layer/head.
