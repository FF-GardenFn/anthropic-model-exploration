# AHOS Framework: Abstract Higher-Order Specification for Activation Calculus

## Introduction

The AHOS (Abstract Higher-Order Specification) framework provides a categorical foundation for specifying and verifying AI agent behavior. The framework enables formal reasoning about safety properties and welfare optimization by combining category theory with practical implementation considerations.

AHOS provides tools for:
- Specifying operational behavior using categorical semantics
- Verifying safety properties via fibration-based methods
- Optimizing welfare through metric structures
- Connecting to RKHS computational implementations

## The Activation Calculus AHOS Specification

### Core Signature

The Activation Calculus operates over the signature:

```
Σ = {app: 2, ⊕: 2, steer: 2, route: 2, Ω: 0}
```

Where:
- `app: 2` - Application operator for function composition
- `⊕: 2` - Choice operator for non-deterministic branching
- `steer: 2` - Steering operator for trajectory modification
- `route: 2` - Routing operator for conditional navigation
- `Ω: 0` - Terminal operator representing completion states

### Behaviour Bifunctor

The semantic interpretation uses the behaviour bifunctor:

```
B(X,Y) = D({⊥} + Y^X)
```

This captures:
- **D(-)**: Probabilistic distribution monad for stochastic semantics
- **{⊥}**: Divergence/non-termination element
- **Y^X**: Function space from inputs X to outputs Y
- **{⊥} + (-)**: Partial function lifting for undefined behavior

The bifunctor B provides probabilistic big-step operational semantics, where each computation step may:
1. Terminate with a probabilistic distribution over outcomes
2. Diverge (represented by ⊥)
3. Produce partial functions capturing input-output relationships

### Depth-2 Rule Morphism

The operational rules are encoded through the depth-2 rule morphism:

```
ρ: Σ(B(X,Y)) → B(Σ(X),Y)
```

This morphism encapsulates the structural operational semantics, mapping signature operations over behavior specifications to behaviors over signature terms. The depth-2 structure ensures proper handling of higher-order operations while maintaining computational decidability.

## Fibration Choices

### Boolean Safety Commitments: Rel Fibration

For boolean safety properties, we employ the **Rel** fibration:

```
Rel: Set^op → CAT
```

This fibration enables:
- **Fiber Rel(X)**: Relations on X representing safety predicates
- **Reindexing**: Pullback along functions for property preservation
- **Lifting**: Extension of relations through operational structure

Safety commitments are expressed as relations R ⊆ X × X, where (x,x') ∈ R indicates that transitioning from state x to x' preserves safety invariants.

### Welfare Distances: FRel Fibration

For welfare optimization, we use the **FRel** fibration over pseudometrics:

```
FRel: Set^op → CAT
```

Where:
- **Fiber FRel(X)**: Pseudometric spaces (X,d) with distance functions d: X × X → [0,∞]
- **Morphisms**: Distance-decreasing maps preserving welfare properties
- **Lifting**: Wasserstein-type extensions for probabilistic welfare

This enables quantitative reasoning about welfare preservation and optimization through metric-based constraints.

### Change of Base for Free Transitions

The change of base construction:

```
F*: Rel → FRel
```

Provides free transitions from boolean to quantitative specifications:
- Maps relations to discrete metrics (0-1 valued)
- Preserves categorical structure through left adjoint
- Enables gradual refinement from boolean to quantitative properties

## Key Liftings

### Divergence Lifting: {⊥}+(-)

The divergence lifting:

```
{⊥}+(-): FRel(X) → FRel({⊥}+X)
```

Extends pseudometrics to handle partial functions:
- d(⊥,⊥) = 0 (divergence is self-equal)
- d(⊥,x) = ∞ for x ≠ ⊥ (divergence maximally distant from termination)
- d(x,y) as inherited from base metric

### Product and Coproduct Liftings

**Product Lifting**:
```
×: FRel(X) × FRel(Y) → FRel(X × Y)
```
Enables compositional reasoning: d_X×Y((x,y), (x',y')) = max(d_X(x,x'), d_Y(y,y'))

**Coproduct Lifting**:
```
+: FRel(X) × FRel(Y) → FRel(X + Y)
```
Handles disjoint union cases with infinite cross-component distances.

### Internal Hom Lifting: H

The internal hom lifting:

```
H: FRel(X) × FRel(Y) → FRel(Y^X)
```

Lifts metrics to function spaces using the uniform metric:
```
d_H(f,g) = sup_{x∈X} d_Y(f(x), g(x))
```

This enables reasoning about function approximation and behavioral similarity.

### Wasserstein Lifting: D

The Wasserstein lifting:

```
W_p: FRel(X) → FRel(D(X))
```

Extends pseudometrics to probability distributions:
```
W_p(μ,ν) = inf_{π∈Π(μ,ν)} (∫ d(x,y)^p dπ(x,y))^{1/p}
```

Where Π(μ,ν) represents transport plans between distributions μ and ν.

## Connection to RKHS Framework

### Kernel Constraints as Conformance Generators

The RKHS kernel k: X × X → ℝ generates conformance pseudometrics:

```
d_k(x,y) = √(k(x,x) + k(y,y) - 2k(x,y))
```

This connects:
- **Positive definiteness** of kernels to metric axioms
- **Reproducing property** to functional evaluation consistency
- **Feature map embeddings** Φ(x) to metric-preserving representations

### Hat Matrix as Pseudometric Source

The hat matrix H = K(K + λI)^{-1} from RKHS regularization provides:

```
d_H(x,y) = |H_{xx} - H_{xy}| + |H_{yy} - H_{yx}|
```

This pseudometric captures:
- **Leverage**: How much influence point x has on predictions
- **Similarity**: Correlation between points in the RKHS
- **Regularization sensitivity**: Effect of λ on distance relationships

### Spectral Drift as Transport Cost

The spectral drift between kernel matrices provides transport costs for the Wasserstein lifting:

```
c_spectral(K_1, K_2) = ||λ(K_1) - λ(K_2)||_2
```

Where λ(K) represents the eigenvalue spectrum, enabling:
- **Distribution shifts** to be measured via spectral changes
- **Transport costs** for probabilistic welfare optimization
- **Kernel adaptation** through spectral alignment
