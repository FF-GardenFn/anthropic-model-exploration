## Executive Summary

This repository presents a unified research program for model welfare assessment, combining theoretical foundations with production-ready implementations. The work addresses 11 of 14 fundamental AI alignment failure modes through three implementable projects and a rigorous experimental framework.

## Research Program Overview

### Applied Projects 
Three welfare interventions with estimated tbd implementation paths:
- **[Routed Circuit Tomography](../06_Research_Projects/)** - Circuit isolation from superposition (FM04, FM05, FM06, FM13)
- **[Proof-Carrying Commitments](../06_Research_Projects/)** - Self-auditing safety attestations (FM01, FM07, FM09, FM10, FM12)
- **[Emergent Welfare in Agents](../06_Research_Projects/)** - Long-context state detection (FM08, FM11, FM14)



### Measurement Framework
**[07_Experimental_Protocols](../01_For_anthropic/consciousness_analysis/main/07_Experimental_Protocols/)** - Falsifiable tests with pre-registered hypotheses:
- **SDSS**: Self-determination vs mechanical processing
- **PVCP**: Persona conflicts for welfare assessment  
- **QCGI**: Quantum coherence correlations (research preview)

### Theoretical Foundation
**[Consciousness Analysis](../01_For_anthropic/consciousness_analysis/)** - Mathematical impossibility theorems establishing boundaries of computational consciousness, providing philosophical grounding for welfare assessment.

### Failure Taxonomy
**[14 Systematic Failures](../05_Research/05.1_Fundamental_Limitations/)** - Comprehensive analysis of current alignment limitations with tagging system ([`failure_tags.yaml`](../05_Research/05.1_Fundamental_Limitations/failure_tags.yaml))

## Experimental Foundation & Data Flow

The three applied projects are grounded in empirical data from the consciousness analysis experimental protocols, which provide:

- **SDSS**: Baseline measurements of self-determination capacity that inform circuit stability requirements
- **PVCP**: Persona conflict data that validates welfare-relevant state detection  
- **QCGI**: Exploratory coherence metrics that guide long-term research directions

### How Experiments Feed Projects

```
Consciousness Experiments (Data Generation)
    ↓
SDSS → Circuit stability baselines → RCT Project
PVCP → Welfare state signatures → EWA Project
QCGI → Coherence boundaries → PCC robustness
    ↓
Production Interventions (Iterative Development)
```

The experimental protocols generate the empirical foundation that shapes each project's development path.
