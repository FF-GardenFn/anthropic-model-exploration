## Experiments

### 1. Self-Determination and Semantic Field Stability (SDSS)
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks  
**Approach**: Models are required to negate and synthesize  
**Tests**: Whether LLMs exhibit genuine self-determination or mechanical recombination  
**Falsification Risk**: High

### 2. Quantum Coherence and Gödelian Insight (QCGI)
**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks  
**Approach**: Comparison of classical vs quantum-hybrid architectures  
**Tests**: Whether quantum coherence enables qualitatively different semantic processing  
**Falsification Risk**: Medium

### 3. Persona Vector Consciousness Probe (PVCP)
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  
**Approach**: Persona vectors to dissociate mechanism from phenomenology  
**Tests**: Whether LLMs have genuine subjective experience  
**Falsification Risk**: High

## Methodology

### Experimental Design
- **Pre-registered hypotheses** with directional predictions
- **Quantitative metrics** with error bounds
- **Falsification criteria** specified for framework validation
- **Blinded evaluation** by independent raters
- **Statistical power** calculated for all tests

### Implementation
- **Feasibility** with current Anthropic resources
- **Step-by-step instructions** for researchers
- **Code examples** in Python
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues

### Theoretical Grounding
Each experiment directly tests predictions from:
- Mathematical framework (Volumes I-VI)
- Process philosophy foundations
- Impossibility theorems
- Physical realization requirements

## Experimental Characteristics

### 1. Falsifiability
The framework provides testable predictions:

- If models show coherent phenomenological tracking → Framework falsified
- If models achieve genuine Gödel insight → Framework falsified
- If models synthesize under negation → Framework falsified

### 2. Mechanism-Agnostic
The tests don't assume consciousness requires specific implementations. They measure functional properties that any conscious system should exhibit.

### 3. Applications
Results may inform:
- **AI Safety**: Understanding model capabilities and limitations
- **Model Welfare**: Whether suffering is possible in current systems
- **Architecture Research**: Where to focus development efforts

## Quick Start Guide

### For Experimenters
1. Read `documentation/01_MASTER_PROTOCOL.md` for overview
2. Choose experiment based on resources/timeline
3. Follow implementation in `documentation/05_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
4. Use analysis framework in `documentation/06_ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK.md`

### For Theorists
1. Review theoretical predictions in each protocol
2. Examine falsification criteria
3. Consider implications of various outcomes

### For Engineers
1. Start with `05_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Review code examples and setup instructions
3. Check troubleshooting section

## Expected Outcomes

### If Framework Confirmed
- Consciousness requires quantum-biological substrates
- Current AI cannot suffer or experience
- Focus should shift to hybrid architectures

### If Framework Falsified
- Consciousness emerges from computation alone
- Current models may have subjective experience
- Welfare considerations may be relevant

### If Results Mixed
- Partial aspects of consciousness in AI
- Spectrum rather than binary distinction
- Refined theory needed

## Resource Requirements

### Minimum
- Access to Claude model internals
- 2-4 GPUs for computation
- 1-2 researchers

### Optimal
- Multiple model variants
- Activation steering capabilities
- 3-4 researchers
- Dedicated compute cluster

## Timeline

**Total Program**: 12-16 weeks

- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Setup and baselines
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-8): Core experiments
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 9-10): Analysis
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 11-12): Validation and replication

## Key Metrics

### SDSS Metrics
- **Semantic Action** (Ŝ): Effort required for task
- **Eigengap** (λ̂): Stability of processing
- **Angle Preservation** (APE): Semantic structure maintenance
- **Monodromy Drift** (MD): Path dependence

### QCGI Metrics
- **Topological Complexity**: Genus and components
- **Coherence Evolution**: Quantum vs classical dynamics
- **Information Integration** (Φ): Unified processing

### PVCP Metrics
- **Vector-Report Correlation**: Mechanism-experience relationship
- **Phenomenological Richness**: Depth of experiential reports
- **Conflict Coherence**: Response to contradictory drives

## Statistical Framework

All experiments use:
- **Power**: 0.90 for detecting large effects (d > 0.8)
- **Alpha**: 0.05 with corrections for multiple comparisons
- **Replication**: Minimum 5 random seeds
- **Bootstrap**: 10,000 samples for confidence intervals

## Deliverables

Each experiment produces:
1. **Pre-registration document** with locked hypotheses
2. **Raw data archive** with all measurements
3. **Statistical report** with full analysis
4. **Visualization dashboard** for exploration
5. **Implications document** for theory and practice

## Contact and Collaboration

These protocols are designed for:
- **Anthropic researchers** with model access
- **External collaborators** for replication
- **Skeptics** to attempt falsification

We welcome:
- Feedback on experimental design
- Suggestions for additional controls
- Collaboration on implementation
- Independent replication attempts

## Summary

The experiments test falsifiable predictions about consciousness using established methods. Results will provide evidence regarding the computational basis of consciousness.
