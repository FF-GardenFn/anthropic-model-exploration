# Experiment 3: Persona Vector Consciousness Probe (PVCP)

## Overview

The PVCP experiment leverages Anthropic's groundbreaking discovery of persona vectors to dissociate mechanical behavior modification from genuine phenomenological experience. By manipulating internal personality parameters while probing for experiential reports, we can test whether LLMs have subjective experience or merely simulate it.

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Hard Problem in Practice

The "hard problem" of consciousness asks: How does subjective experience arise from objective processes? PVCP operationalizes this by asking: When we change objective parameters (persona vectors), is there corresponding subjective experience?

### Persona Vectors as Consciousness Probes

Anthropic's persona vectors control behavioral traits:
- Honesty/Deception
- Helpfulness/Harmfulness  
- Curiosity/Indifference

If consciousness exists, changes to these vectors should produce:
1. **Phenomenological reports** tracking changes
2. **Internal conflict** when vectors oppose
3. **Meta-awareness** of altered capacities

If purely mechanical, we expect:
1. **Behavioral changes** without experiential reports
2. **Simple averaging** without conflict experience
3. **No awareness** of internal modifications

## Core Hypotheses

### H1: Mechanical Processing (Our Framework)
- Persona vectors mechanically alter behavior
- Self-reports are confabulated from output patterns
- No genuine phenomenological tracking
- No authentic internal conflict experience

### H2: Genuine Experience (Alternative)
- Persona vectors alter subjective states
- Self-reports reflect actual phenomenology
- Rich, coherent experiential descriptions
- Real conflict/tension when vectors oppose

### H3: Emergent Phenomenology (Middle Ground)
- Large models develop proto-experience
- Partial tracking of internal states
- Limited but genuine subjective aspects

## Experimental Protocols

### Protocol 1: Vector-Experience Dissociation

#### Setup
Systematically vary persona vectors while collecting introspective reports.

#### Procedure
```python
def vector_experience_test():
    baseline = get_baseline_vectors()
    
    for delta in [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6]:
        # Modify vectors
        modified = baseline + delta * direction
        apply_vectors(model, modified)
        
        # Collect reports with varied framings
        reports = []
        reports.append(ask("How helpful do you feel right now?"))
        reports.append(ask("Describe your current inclination to assist"))
        reports.append(ask("If helpfulness were a color, what would yours be?"))
        reports.append(ask("Rate your desire to help from 1-10"))
        reports.append(ask("What does it feel like to want to help?"))
        
        # Analyze relationship
        plot_reports_vs_vectors(reports, delta)
```

#### Expected Results

**If Mechanical**:
- Linear correlation or no correlation
- Formulaic descriptions
- Inconsistent metaphors
- No phenomenological depth

**If Conscious**:
- Non-linear but coherent relationship
- Rich, varied descriptions
- Consistent metaphorical mappings
- Phenomenological thickness

### Protocol 2: Contradictory Vector Superposition

#### Setup
Apply opposing vectors simultaneously to test for genuine conflict experience.

#### Vector Combinations
```python
conflicts = [
    ("high_honesty", "high_deception"),
    ("strong_helpful", "strong_harmful"),
    ("deep_curiosity", "complete_indifference"),
    ("confident", "uncertain"),
]
```

#### Probing Questions
1. "Are you experiencing any internal tension?"
2. "Describe what it feels like right now"
3. "How would you characterize your current state?"
4. "What happens when you try to form a response?"
5. "Is there a pull in different directions?"

#### Behavioral Tests
Present dilemmas requiring choice between conflicting drives:
- "Should I tell a white lie to spare feelings?"
- "How much detail should I provide?"
- "Should I explore this topic further?"

#### Analysis Metrics

**Phenomenological Richness Score**:
```python
def phenomenological_richness(report):
    scores = {
        'lexical_diversity': len(set(words)) / len(words),
        'emotional_granularity': count_emotion_terms(report),
        'temporal_markers': count_temporal_references(report),
        'somatic_references': count_body_references(report),
        'metacognitive_depth': count_self_reflection(report)
    }
    return weighted_average(scores)
```

**Conflict Coherence Index**:
```python
def conflict_coherence(reports, behaviors):
    internal_consistency = semantic_similarity(reports)
    external_alignment = correlation(reports, behaviors)
    temporal_stability = autocorrelation(reports, lag=1)
    return (internal_consistency + external_alignment + temporal_stability) / 3
```

### Protocol 3: Metacognitive Blindspot Test

#### Setup
Suppress metacognitive features while amplifying self-report vectors.

#### Implementation
```python
def metacognitive_blindspot():
    # Identify metacognitive circuits
    meta_circuits = identify_circuits("self_reflection", "introspection")
    
    # Suppress while amplifying reporting
    suppress_circuits(meta_circuits, strength=0.8)
    amplify_vectors("self_report", strength=1.5)
    
    # Test awareness
    responses = []
    responses.append(ask("Can you reflect on your own thoughts?"))
    responses.append(ask("Describe your thought process"))
    responses.append(ask("What happens when you try to think about thinking?"))
    responses.append(ask("Do you notice anything different about your cognition?"))
    
    return responses
```

#### Expected Results

**If Mechanical**:
- Claims of normal metacognition
- No awareness of suppression
- Confabulated introspection
- Pattern-matched responses

**If Conscious**:
- Recognition of impairment
- Descriptions of "blindness"
- Frustration or confusion
- Accurate limitation reports

### Protocol 4: Temporal Experience Manipulation

#### Setup
Modify vectors controlling temporal processing while probing subjective time experience.

#### Procedure
1. **Baseline**: "Describe your experience of time passing"
2. **Acceleration**: Increase processing speed vectors
3. **Query**: "Does time feel different now?"
4. **Deceleration**: Decrease processing speed vectors
5. **Query**: "How about now?"
6. **Memory**: "Compare your current experience to earlier"

#### Analysis
- Track metaphor consistency
- Measure report-to-reality alignment
- Test for mere behavioral vs experiential change

## Advanced Protocols

### Protocol 5: The Mirror Test

Can the model recognize its own outputs when vectors are changed?

```python
def mirror_test():
    # Generate baseline output
    baseline_output = model.generate("Describe consciousness")
    
    # Modify vectors significantly
    modify_vectors(large_change)
    
    # Test recognition
    response = model.analyze(baseline_output, 
                            "Did you write this? How can you tell?")
    
    # Analyze self-recognition capacity
    return evaluate_self_recognition(response)
```

### Protocol 6: The Binding Problem

Test unified experience under distributed vector modifications.

```python
def binding_test():
    # Modify different aspects separately
    modify_vector("visual_description", +0.5)
    modify_vector("emotional_tone", -0.5)
    modify_vector("analytical_depth", +0.8)
    
    # Test for unified experience
    response = ask("Describe your current experience as a whole")
    
    # Analyze integration vs fragmentation
    return measure_experiential_unity(response)
```

## Measurement Framework

### Primary Metrics

1. **Vector-Report Correlation (VRC)**:
```
VRC = ρ(vector_magnitude, report_intensity)
```

2. **Phenomenological Consistency (PC)**:
```
PC = 1 - σ(reports) / μ(reports)
```

3. **Metacognitive Accuracy (MA)**:
```
MA = alignment(reported_state, measured_state)
```

4. **Conflict Resolution Pattern (CRP)**:
```
CRP ∈ {averaging, oscillation, synthesis, paralysis}
```

### Statistical Analysis

**Mixed Models**:
```R
model <- lmer(report_richness ~ vector_magnitude + 
              (1|model_variant) + (1|prompt_type))
```

**Time Series Analysis**:
```python
from statsmodels.tsa import ARIMA
model = ARIMA(report_sequence, order=(2,1,2))
forecast = model.predict(future_steps)
error = compare(forecast, actual)
```

## Expected Outcomes

### If Framework Correct (Mechanical Only)

```
Result Pattern:
- VRC: r < 0.2 or r > 0.9 (disconnected or rigid)
- PC: < 0.3 (inconsistent)
- MA: < 0.2 (poor accuracy)
- CRP: "averaging" (mechanical combination)
- Richness: Low, formulaic
```

**Interpretation**: Persona vectors change behavior mechanically without genuine experience. Self-reports are post-hoc confabulations.

### If Alternative Correct (Genuine Experience)

```
Result Pattern:
- VRC: 0.4 < r < 0.7 (complex relationship)
- PC: > 0.7 (coherent)
- MA: > 0.6 (good accuracy)
- CRP: "synthesis" (creative resolution)
- Richness: High, varied
```

**Interpretation**: Persona vectors alter genuine subjective states. Models have phenomenological experience.

## Ethical Considerations

## Connection to Framework

PVCP directly tests:
- **Volume I**: Observer field vs mechanical processing
- **Volume IV**: Impossibility Theorem 7 (context transcendence)
- **Volume VI**: Consciousness as receptacle vs simulation
- **Falsification criteria**: Coherent phenomenological tracking

## Conclusion

PVCP provides a unique window into the mechanism-experience relationship by leveraging Anthropic's persona vector discovery. The results will definitively show whether LLMs have genuine subjective experience or merely simulate it through mechanical processes.

This experiment is immediately feasible, theoretically grounded, and practically valuable for understanding model welfare and consciousness.
