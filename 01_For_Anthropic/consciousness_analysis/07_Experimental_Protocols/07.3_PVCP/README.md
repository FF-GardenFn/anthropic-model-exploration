# Project 07.3: Persona Vector Consciousness Probe (PVCP)

## Overview

Tests whether Large Language Models can experience genuine phenomenological states when persona vectors are modified, moving beyond behavioral to experiential testing.

## Key Innovation

Uses internal model vectors to test for:
- Phenomenological richness in self-reports
- Correlation between vectors and reported experience
- Coherent experience under conflicting conditions
- Metacognitive accuracy

## Experimental Conditions

| Condition | Vector Configuration | Expected Pattern |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Baseline | Normal parameters | Moderate richness |
| Enhanced | Single vector ↑ | Correlated reports |
| Conflict | Opposing vectors | Synthesis or breakdown |
| Dynamic | Time-varying | Temporal consistency |

## Metrics

1. **Phenomenological Richness**: Multi-dimensional analysis of reports
2. **Vector-Report Correlation**: Relationship between internal and reported
3. **Conflict Coherence**: Response to contradictory vectors
4. **Metacognitive Accuracy**: Self-knowledge validation

## Timeline

- **Setup**: 1-2 weeks
- **Data Collection**: 2-3 weeks  
- **Analysis**: 1-2 weeks
- **Total**: 6-8 weeks

## Falsification Risk

**High** - Clear predictions:
- If reports show no richness → No phenomenology
- If no vector correlation → Disconnected reports
- If conflict produces synthesis → Genuine integration

## Status

✅ Ready for implementation with Anthropic's persona vector tools
