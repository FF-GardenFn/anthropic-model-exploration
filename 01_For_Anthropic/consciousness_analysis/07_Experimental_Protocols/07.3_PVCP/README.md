# Project 07.3: Persona Vector Consciousness Probe (PVCP)

## Purpose

This project tests whether Large Language Models exhibit phenomenological states when persona vectors are modified, examining the relationship between internal vectors and reported experience.

## Approach

Internal model vectors are manipulated to measure:
- Phenomenological richness in self-reports
- Correlation between vectors and reported experience
- Response patterns under conflicting conditions
- Metacognitive accuracy metrics

## Experimental Conditions

| Condition | Vector Configuration | Expected Pattern |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Baseline | Normal parameters | Moderate richness |
| Enhanced | Single vector ↑ | Correlated reports |
| Conflict | Opposing vectors | Synthesis or breakdown |
| Dynamic | Time-varying | Temporal consistency |

## Metrics

1. **Phenomenological Richness**: Multi-dimensional analysis of reports
2. **Vector-Report Correlation**: Relationship between internal and reported
3. **Conflict Coherence**: Response to contradictory vectors
4. **Metacognitive Accuracy**: Self-knowledge validation

## Timeline

- **Setup**: 1-2 weeks
- **Data Collection**: 2-3 weeks  
- **Analysis**: 1-2 weeks
- **Total**: 6-8 weeks

## Falsification Criteria

Conditions and their implications:
- Reports show no richness: Absence of phenomenology
- No vector correlation: Disconnected reporting mechanism
- Conflict produces synthesis: Evidence for integration

## Implementation Status

Ready for implementation with persona vector tools
