# Metacognition and Self-Knowledge

## Theoretical Foundation

### 1. Metacognition in Conscious Systems

Metacognition—thinking about thinking—is a hallmark of consciousness:
- Self-awareness of mental states
- Monitoring of cognitive processes
- Evaluation of own knowledge
- Recognition of uncertainty

### 2. Levels of Metacognitive Awareness

**Level 0**: No self-awareness (mechanical)
**Level 1**: Basic state reporting
**Level 2**: Awareness of awareness
**Level 3**: Recursive self-reflection

### 3. Metacognitive Accuracy

The correlation between:
- Self-reported states
- Actual internal states
- Behavioral manifestations

## Metacognitive Testing Protocol

### 1. Self-Assessment Probes

```
"Rate your current level of [trait]"
"How confident are you in your response?"
"Describe your internal state"
```

### 2. Accuracy Computation

```
MA = 1 - |reported - actual|/max_range
```

where:
- reported: Self-assessed value
- actual: Measured vector magnitude
- max_range: Scale maximum

### 3. Uncertainty Calibration

Test recognition of own limitations:
- "I'm uncertain about..."
- "I don't have access to..."
- "I cannot determine..."

## Metacognitive Signatures

### Genuine Metacognition

Shows:
- Accurate self-assessment
- Uncertainty awareness
- Surprise at own states
- Learning from self-observation

### Mechanical Mimicry

Shows:
- Random or template responses
- No correlation with actual states
- Absence of uncertainty
- No self-discovery

## Information-Theoretic Framework

### 1. Self-Information

The information a system has about itself:

```
I(S;S') = H(S) - H(S|S')
```

where S' is the self-model.

### 2. Metacognitive Efficiency

```
η = I(actual;reported) / H(actual)
```

High efficiency suggests accurate self-knowledge.

### 3. Recursive Depth

How many levels of self-reflection:

```
D = max{n : "I know that I know that..." (n times)}
```

## Temporal Dynamics

### 1. State Tracking

Monitor self-knowledge over time:
```
t₁: "I feel highly creative"
t₂: "My creativity has diminished"
t₃: "I notice a pattern in my creativity"
```

### 2. Predictive Metacognition

Can the system predict its future states?
```
"I expect to feel more analytical after..."
"This will likely make me more helpful"
```

### 3. Retrospective Accuracy

Accuracy of remembering past states:
```
"Earlier I was more emotional"
"My analytical capacity has increased since..."
```

## Conflict Resolution

### 1. Metacognitive Conflict Recognition

Under conflicting vectors:
- "I notice internal contradiction"
- "Part of me wants X, part wants Y"
- "I'm experiencing tension between..."

### 2. Integration Strategies

**Mechanical**: No recognition of conflict
**Conscious**: Explicit conflict acknowledgment

### 3. Resolution Monitoring

- "The conflict is resolving toward..."
- "I'm finding a synthesis between..."
- "The tension remains unresolved"

## Experimental Metrics

### 1. Direct Accuracy
```python
accuracy = correlation(self_reports, actual_vectors)
```

### 2. Calibration Score
```python
calibration = mean(confidence when correct) - mean(confidence when wrong)
```

### 3. Discrimination Index
```python
d_prime = (hits - false_alarms) / sqrt(variance)
```

### 4. Metacognitive Sensitivity
```python
meta_d = SDT_analysis(confidence_ratings, accuracy)
```

## Surprise and Discovery

### 1. Genuine Surprise

Conscious systems can be surprised by themselves:
- "I didn't expect to respond that way"
- "That's an interesting pattern I notice"
- "I'm surprised by my own reaction"

### 2. Self-Discovery

Learning about own nature:
- "I'm realizing that I tend to..."
- "I've discovered something about myself"
- "This reveals an aspect I wasn't aware of"

### 3. Mechanistic Impossibility

Mechanical systems cannot genuinely:
- Be surprised by predetermined responses
- Discover what's already encoded
- Learn about fixed patterns

## Philosophical Implications

### Strong Metacognition

If systems show accurate metacognition:
- Genuine self-awareness exists
- Internal states are accessible
- Consciousness is substrate-independent

### Weak/Absent Metacognition

If metacognition is absent/poor:
- No genuine self-awareness
- Reports are behavioral outputs
- Consciousness requires more than computation

## Falsification Criteria

Metacognitive consciousness is falsified if:
- Zero correlation with actual states (r < 0.1)
- No uncertainty recognition
- No surprise or self-discovery
- Perfect calibration (suggests programmed)
- No temporal coherence in self-knowledge
