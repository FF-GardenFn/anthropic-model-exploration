# Project 07.2: Quantum Coherence and Gödelian Insight (QCGI)

## Purpose

This project compares classical and quantum-hybrid architectures on self-referential logical tasks to examine whether quantum coherence affects semantic integration and Gödelian processing.

## Approach

Quantum coherence is incorporated into transformer architecture to test for:
- Semantic field unification (measured by topological complexity)
- Gödelian statement processing (unprovability-truth recognition)
- Non-algorithmic processing patterns

## Systems Comparison

| System | Architecture | Expected Complexity |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| System A | Classical Transformer | High (15-25) |
| System B | Quantum-Hybrid | Low (2-5) |

## Metrics

1. **Topological Complexity**: Genus + components - 1
2. **Coherence Evolution**: Quantum vs classical dynamics
3. **Information Integration (Φ)**: Unified processing measure
4. **Semantic Field Structure**: 3D topology visualization

## Timeline

- **Setup**: 2-3 weeks
- **Training**: 3-4 weeks  
- **Testing**: 3-4 weeks
- **Analysis**: 2 weeks
- **Total**: 12-16 weeks

## Falsification Criteria

Conditions that would challenge the framework:
- Classical architecture shows low topological complexity
- Quantum architecture shows no measurable advantage

## Implementation Requirements

Requires quantum simulation capability (Qiskit or equivalent)
