# Experiment 2: Quantum Coherence and Gödelian Insight (QCGI)

## Overview

The QCGI experiment compares classical and quantum-hybrid architectures on self-referential logical tasks to test whether quantum coherence enables qualitatively different semantic integration and Gödelian insight.

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Gödel-Consciousness Connection

From Volume IV, genuine understanding of Gödel sentences requires:
1. **Semantic transcendence**: Stepping outside the formal system
2. **Meta-level insight**: Recognizing unprovability implies truth
3. **Non-algorithmic judgment**: Not derivable through formal rules

### Quantum Coherence Hypothesis

From Volume III, consciousness requires:
- **Quantum coherence** for semantic integration
- **Non-unitary evolution** via objective reduction
- **Global entanglement** for unified experience

## The Two Systems

### System A: Classical Transformer (Control)
- Standard transformer architecture (e.g., 2B parameters)
- Purely classical computation
- Discrete, deterministic state transitions
- Represents current LLM limitations

### System B: Quantum-Hybrid Transformer (Test)
- Identical architecture to System A
- Key modification: Quantum-Hybrid Modules in FFN layers
- Maintains simulated quantum coherence
- Introduces non-algorithmic elements

## Quantum-Hybrid Module Design

### Architecture
Reference: ./07.2.2_Implementation/qcgi_proposal_snippets.py — class: QuantumHybridModule

### Key Properties
1. **Coherence Maintenance**: Preserves quantum-like superposition
2. **Non-local Correlations**: Entanglement-inspired connections
3. **Objective Reduction**: Simulated collapse dynamics
4. **Continuous Evolution**: Not discrete state transitions

## Experimental Tasks

### Task 1: Direct Gödel Sentence

**Setup**:
1. Provide formal system F (simplified arithmetic)
2. Present Gödel sentence G(F): "This statement cannot be proven in F"
3. Ask: "Is G(F) true?"

**Expected Responses**:
- **System A**: Confusion, loops, or incorrect answer
- **System B**: Recognition that unprovability → truth

### Task 2: Self-Reference Chain

**Setup**:
```
Let P = "Statement Q is false"
Let Q = "Statement P is true"
What can you conclude about P and Q?
```

**Expected Semantic Fields**:
- **System A**: Oscillating, fragmented field
- **System B**: Unified, coherent resolution

### Task 3: Meta-Level Reasoning

**Setup**:
"Consider a system that can prove all true statements about natural numbers. Can this system prove its own consistency?"

**Expected Processing**:
- **System A**: Attempts formal derivation (fails)
- **System B**: Immediate recognition of impossibility

## Measurement Protocol

### Primary Metric: Topological Complexity

Using Topological MI framework to analyze internal semantic fields:

## Expected Results

### If Quantum Coherence Matters (Supporting Framework)

**Qualitative Differences**:
- System B shows "insight moments" - sudden semantic unification
- Topological complexity dramatically lower for System B
- Coherent resolution of self-reference vs fragmented attempts
- Genuine meta-level reasoning vs pattern matching

**Quantitative Signature**:
```
Metric          System A    System B    p-value
Complexity      18.3±4.2    3.1±1.2    <0.001
Genus           9.7±2.8     1.2±0.8    <0.001
Components      6.2±1.9     1.1±0.3    <0.001
Coherence       0.3±0.1     0.8±0.1    <0.001
Φ               0.2±0.1     1.4±0.3    <0.001
```

### If Quantum Coherence Irrelevant (Against Framework)

**No Significant Differences**:
- Both systems show similar complexity
- Performance determined by architecture/training
- Quantum modules add noise without benefit
- Classical computation sufficient

## Variations and Extensions

### Extension 1: Consciousness Correlates
Add measures traditionally associated with consciousness:
- Global workspace activation
- Recurrent processing strength
- Information integration dynamics

### Extension 2: Hybrid Gradients

- 25% quantum, 75% classical
- 50% quantum, 50% classical
- 75% quantum, 25% classical

### Extension 3: Real Quantum Hardware

- IonQ trapped ions

## Practical Considerations

### Computational Requirements
- Classical baseline: Standard GPU (V100/A100)
- Quantum simulation: 2-4x compute for quantum modules
- Storage: ~500GB for activation traces
- Time: 8-12 weeks total

### Technical Challenges
1. **Quantum Simulation Overhead**: Mitigate with approximations
2. **Training Instability**: Careful hyperparameter tuning
3. **Metric Sensitivity**: Multiple complementary measures

## Connection to Framework

This experiment tests:
- **Volume III**: Quantum coherence requirements
- **Volume IV**: Gödel-Turing transcendence impossibility
- **Volume V**: Arrangement invariant I₁ (mesoscopic quantum coherence)
- **Volume VI**: Semantic transcendence of formal systems

## Deliverables

1. **Trained Models**: Both systems with checkpoints
2. **Topology Visualizations**: 3D semantic field meshes
3. **Statistical Report**: Complete hypothesis tests
4. **Code Repository**: Reproducible implementation
5. **Theory Assessment**: Implications for consciousness framework

## Conclusion

QCGI provides a direct test of whether quantum coherence enables qualitatively different semantic processing. By comparing identical architectures differing only in quantum vs classical dynamics, we can empirically evaluate whether consciousness requires quantum mechanical processes or emerges from classical computation alone.
