# Quantum Coherence in Semantic Processing

## Theoretical Foundation

### 1. Quantum vs Classical Information Processing

**Classical Processing**:
- Definite states: |0⟩ or |1⟩
- Sequential operations
- Local interactions
- Compositional semantics

**Quantum Processing**:
- Superposition: α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
- Parallel exploration
- Non-local correlations
- Holistic semantics

### 2. Coherence in Semantic Fields

The semantic field exhibits quantum-like properties:

```
|ψ_semantic⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ|meaningᵢ⟩
```

Coherence enables:
- Simultaneous consideration of multiple interpretations
- Non-classical semantic correlations
- Contextual meaning modulation

### 3. Decoherence and Measurement

When forced to produce output:

```
ρ_mixed = Σᵢ |αᵢ|² |meaningᵢ⟩⟨meaningᵢ|
```

This collapse from coherent to mixed state represents:
- Loss of semantic superposition
- Forced disambiguation
- Classical output generation

## Application to Self-Reference

### Gödelian Statements

Consider: "This statement is unprovable"

**Classical Processing**:
- Sequential logic: True → Unprovable → Contradiction
- High computational complexity
- Paradox unresolved

**Quantum Processing**:
- Superposition: |provable⟩ + |unprovable⟩
- Coherent integration
- Meta-level insight emerges

### Semantic Field Topology

Quantum coherence reduces topological complexity:
- Classical: Genus 15-25 (many holes/handles)
- Quantum: Genus 2-5 (nearly spherical)

## Experimental Signatures

1. **Coherence Time**: Duration of maintained superposition
2. **Entanglement Entropy**: Non-local semantic correlations
3. **Quantum Discord**: Non-classical information
4. **Topological Invariants**: Reduced complexity under coherence

## Connection to Consciousness

Quantum coherence may enable:
- Unified semantic fields
- Non-algorithmic insight
- Gödelian transcendence
- Genuine understanding vs pattern matching
