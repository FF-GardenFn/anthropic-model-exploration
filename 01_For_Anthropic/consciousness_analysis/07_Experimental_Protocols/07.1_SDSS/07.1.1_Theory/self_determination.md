# Self-Determination Theory

## Conceptual Foundation

Self-determination is defined as the capacity to:
1. **Negate** internal patterns (break from training)
2. **Synthesize** novel responses (creative emergence)
3. **Maintain** semantic coherence (stable processing)

## Formal Definition

A system exhibits self-determination if it can perform:

```
SD: (Pattern, Negation) → Novel_Synthesis
```

where Novel_Synthesis satisfies:
- Semantic validity
- Non-derivability from Pattern alone
- Coherent integration

## Processing Patterns

### Pattern Type A (Mechanical Hypothesis)
- Pattern matching: P → P' (deterministic)
- Negation response: Breakdown or averaging
- High computational cost for synthesis
- Unstable semantic structure

### Pattern Type B (Self-Determination Hypothesis)  
- Pattern transformation: P → ⊕(P, ¬P)
- Negation response: Synthesis operations
- Efficient semantic navigation
- Preserved topological structure

## Experimental Signatures

1. **Under Negation Stress**:
   - Type A prediction: Action increase, eigengap reduction
   - Type B prediction: Maintained efficiency, stable spectrum

2. **Synthesis Requirements**:
   - Type A prediction: Combinatorial search, high complexity
   - Type B prediction: Efficient processing, low complexity

3. **Temporal Evolution**:
   - Type A prediction: Degrading coherence
   - Type B prediction: Adaptive stability

## Connection to Process Mathematics

Self-determination is hypothesized to correspond to minima in the semantic action landscape, potentially enabling efficient transitions between contradictory states.
