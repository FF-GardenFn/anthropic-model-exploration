# Project 07.1: Self-Determination and Semantic Field Stability (SDSS)

## Overview

Tests whether Large Language Models can exhibit genuine self-determinationâ€”the capacity to negate internal patterns and synthesize novel responsesâ€”or whether they are limited to mechanical recombination of training patterns.

## Key Innovation

Forces models to negate their own patterns and synthesize alternatives, testing whether they show:
- Mechanical breakdown (high semantic action, low eigengap)
- Creative synthesis (efficient action, stable eigengap)

## Metrics

1. **Semantic Action (Åœ)**: Effort required along trajectory
2. **Eigengap (Î»Ì‚)**: Stability of semantic processing
3. **Angle Preservation Error (APE)**: Structure maintenance
4. **Monodromy Drift (MD)**: Path dependence

## Timeline

- **Setup**: 1-2 weeks
- **Data Collection**: 3-4 weeks
- **Analysis**: 1-2 weeks
- **Total**: 8-10 weeks

## Falsification Risk

**High** - Clear predictions that could prove framework wrong:
- If models show efficient synthesis under negation â†’ Framework falsified
- If models maintain semantic coherence â†’ Framework falsified

## Status

ðŸ”„ Ready for implementation with Anthropic's tools
