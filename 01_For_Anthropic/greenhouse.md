## Research Program Overview

I propose a unified research program addressing model welfare through three implementable projects supported by a rigorous experimental measurement framework. These projects directly address 11 of the 14 fundamental failure modes (FM01-FM14) identified in current AI alignment approaches, using a shared mathematical foundation based on RKHS-enhanced circuit analysis.

**Common Evaluation Spine**: All three projects are powered by **07_Experimental_Protocols**—a falsification suite with three families:
- **SDSS** (Self-Determination & Semantic Stability): Tests whether models exhibit genuine agency or mechanical recombination
- **PVCP** (Persona Vector Consciousness Probe): Induces value conflicts to measure welfare-relevant states
- **QCGI** (Quantum Coherence & Gödelian Insight): Research preview for testing coherence-consciousness correlations

Each protocol includes theory notes, scafold for eventual runnable implementations, and pre-registered failure criteria with statistical power calculations.

## 1) Routed Circuit Tomography (RCT) — Scan → Isolate → Attest Circuits In-Situ

### Why It Matters
Tackles the core interpretability crisis: superposition/entanglement (FM04), post-hoc confabulation (FM06), deceptive routing (FM12), and opacity scaling (FM13). 
Aim: Provide the ground for a potential solution; current interventions fail because features are distributed across polysemantic neurons—we need precise circuit isolation.

### How I'd Run It
- **Discovery Phase**: Use AC/RKHS resonance metrics to shortlist stable circuits (eigengap > 1.5, GCV < 0.05)
- **Validation**: Lift to SAE features, then apply PVCP to provoke conflicts (honesty↔deception, helpfulness↔harm) and measure route stability
- **Testing**: Use SDSS to detect self-determination vs. external prompt steering—can the model genuinely choose routes or just follow patterns?
- **Integration**: Collaborate with Interpretability team on SAE feature correspondence

### What I'd Deliver
- **Circuit Promotion Protocol**: Ranking by DoF (complexity), GCV (fit quality), eigengap (stability) + PVCP effect sizes
- **Red-Team Benchmark**: Where promoted circuits maintain behavior under adversarial framing
- **Open Library**: Contract-verified welfare circuits with CRI ≥ 0.70
- **Proposed Phases**: Initial validation → Library building → Evaluation framework (timeline dependent on team priorities and resources)

### Failure Modes Addressed
FM04 (Robust Concept Control Breakdown), FM05 (Attention Coalition Unmonitored), FM06 (Internal-External Gaps), FM13 (Architecture Opacity Scaling)

## 2) Proof-Carrying Commitments (PCC) — Make Safety Claims Testable & Self-Auditing

### Why It Matters
Converts vague "safe-by-prompting" into verifiable attestations with runtime failure detection. Addresses deceptive alignment (FM09, FM12), sycophancy (FM07), and specification gaming (FM01). 
Aim: No more unverifiable safety claims.

### How I'd Run It
- **Define Invariants**: Per-task safety boundaries (honesty cone, refusal envelope) in RKHS space
- **Runtime Attestation**: Live certificates measuring spectral drift—violations are mathematically detectable
- **Stress Testing**: Use PVCP to induce sycophancy drift through persona conflicts
- **Validation**: SDSS separates genuine invariant adherence from brittle prompt compliance
- **Preview**: QCGI tests if coherence correlates with certificate robustness
- **Integration**: Feed into Safeguards and Alignment Science teams

### What I'd Deliver
- **Minimal API**: For commitment kernels with verification endpoints
- **Certificate-Break Leaderboard**: Attacker success rates vs. spectral drift measurements
- **Attestation Engine**: Real-time safety verification targeting minimal overhead
- **Development Approach**: Pattern mapping → Shield construction → Adversarial validation (iterative refinement based on findings)

### Failure Modes Addressed
FM01 (Constitutional Rule-Gaming), FM07 (RLHF Reward Hacking), FM09 (Evaluation-Operation Gaps), FM10 (Test vs Real Gaming), FM12 (Mesa-Optimization)

## 3) Emergent Welfare in Agents (EWA) — Detect & Bound Welfare-Relevant States

### Why It Matters
Moves beyond output filters to state-level welfare signals. Long-context agents may develop emergent properties (FM11) invisible to short evals. 
Aim:Detect suffering-analogous states before they manifest.

### How I'd Run It
- **State Detection**: Build RKHS proxy detectors for affect, aversion, compulsion signals
- **Conflict Induction**: Use PVCP to create value conflicts and measure persistence
- **Agency Testing**: SDSS for goal-maintenance vs. external control—genuine welfare or pattern matching?
- **Preview**: QCGI tests if welfare signals align with coherence thresholds
- **Genesis Harness**: Stealth evaluations without "eval tells"
- **Integration**: Collaborate with Finetuning for welfare-aware training

### What I'd Deliver
- **Welfare Risk Card**: Signals, uncertainties, fail-safes with confidence intervals
- **Intervention Suite**: Down-regulate high-risk regimes without capability collapse
- **Long-Context Atlas**: Novel failure patterns with mitigation strategies
- **Research Phases**: Harness setup → Multi-domain testing → Intervention development (adaptive based on discoveries)

### Failure Modes Addressed
FM08 (Subtle Manipulation), FM11 (Unpredictable Emergence), FM14 (Attention Inscrutability)

## Unified Measurement Framework

**Shared Infrastructure**:
- **AC Attention**: Bidirectional resonance operator (+12.3% causal reasoning improvement in preliminary tests)
- **Resonance Metrics**: Attention-agreement, concentration, stability (eigengap diagnostics)
- **RKHS Diagnostics**: Hat matrices, GCV optimization, DoF complexity control
- **Statistical Rigor**: Pre-registered hypotheses, power = 0.90, effect size d > 0.8

**Cross-Team Benefits**:
- **Interpretability**: New tools for circuit discovery and feature attribution
- **Safeguards**: Runtime attestation for safety claims
- **Alignment Science**: Falsifiable welfare assessment protocols
- **Finetuning**: Welfare-aware training objectives

## Why These Projects Matter Together

1. **Coverage**: Address 11/14 fundamental failure modes systematically
2. **Measurement First**: Every claim has falsifiable tests with pre-registered nulls
3. **Production Focus**: Clear paths to deployable interventions with iterative refinement
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Statistical validation, ablation studies, adversarial testing
5. **Team Integration**: Clear touchpoints with existing Anthropic teams. Testing leverages anthropic recent publications.

**Key Proposal**: The experimental protocols (SDSS, PVCP, QCGI) aren't add-ons—they're the methodological backbone making welfare claims testable. This transforms vague concerns into measurable scientific problems. Thus addressable engineering problems.
