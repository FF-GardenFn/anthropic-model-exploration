# 5.4 Research Roadmap and Implementation Strategy

> **Foundation**: [Field-Theoretic Framework](03.5.2_field_theoretic_framework.md) | **Transition**: [Attention to Field Dynamics](03.5.3_attention_to_field_transition.md)

## Strategic Research Framework

The exploration of field-theoretic computational architectures would require a systematic research program that balances theoretical development with empirical validation. This roadmap outlines potential research priorities, validation frameworks, and implementation milestones for investigating the transition from discrete attention mechanisms to continuous field dynamics.

The approach would build incrementally upon available foundations while maintaining focus on the fundamental goal: exploring whether the three architectural limitations identified in TAB1 might be addressed through computational paradigm exploration.
