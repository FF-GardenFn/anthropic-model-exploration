# Introduction

This directory provides an introduction to key concepts and the  mathematical frameworks used throughout this repo. key concepts including morphemic pole detection, AC circuit discovery, and the Principle of Least Semantic Action using an analogy which hopefully the reader will find intuitive!

**Primary Concepts Introduced:**
- Morphemes as mathematical operators in semantic space
- Statistical validation of attention circuits
- Semantic action as computational trajectory cost
- Applications to AI safety and interpretability

## Key Terminology

**Morphemic Pole**: Mathematical singularity in semantic field corresponding to linguistic morpheme (prefix/suffix).

**AC Circuit Discovery**: Adaptive Chaotic framework for identifying statistically significant attention patterns through bidirectional resonance analysis.

**Semantic Action**: Integrated computational cost along reasoning trajectory, analogous to action in classical mechanics.

**RKHS**: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space framework connecting attention mechanisms to kernel ridge regression.
