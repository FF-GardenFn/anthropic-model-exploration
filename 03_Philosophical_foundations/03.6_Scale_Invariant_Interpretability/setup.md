## Experimental Protocols

### Protocol 1: Invariant Conservation Test
1. Load model at scale n
2. Compute full invariant suite I(n)
3. Load model at scale m > n
4. Compute invariants I(m)
5. Test conservation: |I(m) - f(m/n)·I(n)| < ε

### Protocol 2: Phase Transition Detection
1. Create fine-grained model spectrum
2. Compute invariants at each scale
3. Calculate derivatives to find discontinuities
4. Correlate with capability emergence

### Protocol 3: Cross-Architecture Universality
1. Select models with different architectures
2. Match invariants through optimization
3. Compare behavioral similarities
4. Validate universality hypothesis

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Conservation accuracy**: ≥90% invariants conserved within 10% tolerance
- **Prediction accuracy**: ≥80% capability prediction from small model analysis

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
