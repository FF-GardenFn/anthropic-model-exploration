# Mathematical Formalization of Scale-Invariant Interpretability

## Formal Framework

### Definition 1: Model Scaling Operator

Let M_θ be a neural network with parameters θ ∈ ℝ^d. Define the scaling operator S_n as:

```
S_n: M_θ → M_{nθ}
```

where nθ represents a model with n times the parameters, preserving architectural ratios.

### Definition 2: Invariant Functional

A functional I: M → ℝ is scale-invariant of order α if:

```
I[S_n(M)] = n^α · I[M] + o(n^α)
```

When α = 0, we have exact scale invariance.

### Definition 3: Universality Class

Models M₁, M₂ belong to the same universality class U if:

```
∃ continuous φ: I[M₁] → I[M₂] preserving critical exponents
```

## Renormalization Group Formalism

### RG Flow Equations

For model parameters g = (g₁, ..., g_k), the RG flow is:

```
dg_i/d(log b) = β_i(g₁, ..., g_k)
```

where b is the scaling factor and β_i are the beta functions.

### Fixed Point Analysis

At fixed point g*, we have β_i(g*) = 0. Linearizing near g*:

```
β_i(g) ≈ ∑_j B_{ij}(g_j - g*_j)
```

The eigenvalues λ_i of B_{ij} determine scaling dimensions:

```
y_i = -λ_i / log b
```

### Critical Exponents

Define order parameter m(g) and correlation length ξ(g):

```
m(g) ~ |g - g*|^β
ξ(g) ~ |g - g*|^{-ν}
```

**Theorem 1**: For models in the same universality class, β and ν are invariant.

*Proof sketch*: Follows from RG fixed point uniqueness and dimensional analysis. □

## Topological Invariants

### Persistent Homology

For activation manifold A ⊂ ℝ^n, define filtration:

```
A_0 ⊂ A_1 ⊂ ... ⊂ A_k = A
```

The persistence diagram PD(A) tracks birth/death of topological features.

**Theorem 2**: The persistent Betti numbers β_k^{[a,b]} are scale-invariant for sufficiently large models.

*Proof*: Consider the nerve complex N(A) with covering U_ε. As model scales:

```
N(S_n(A)) ≅ N(A) (homotopy equivalence)
```

Therefore H_k(S_n(A)) ≅ H_k(A), preserving Betti numbers. □

### Euler Characteristic

For attention graph G = (V, E):

```
χ(G) = |V| - |E| + |F|
```

**Proposition 1**: χ(G) scales predictably: χ(S_n(G)) = f(n)·χ(G) where f(n) → c as n → ∞.

## Holomorphic Invariants

### Residue Conservation

For semantic field ψ: ℂ → ℂ with poles {z_i}:

```
∑_i Res(ψ, z_i) = 0 (by residue theorem)
```

**Theorem 3**: The residue sum is exactly conserved under model scaling.

*Proof*: Model scaling preserves holomorphic structure:

```
ψ_{S_n(M)}(z) = T_n[ψ_M(z)]
```

where T_n is a Möbius transformation preserving residues. □

### Monodromy Invariants

For multi-valued semantic function with branch points {b_j}:

```
M_γ: π_1(ℂ \ {b_j}) → GL(n, ℂ)
```

The monodromy group Mon(ψ) = Im(M_γ) characterizes global structure.

**Theorem 4**: Mon(ψ_{S_n(M)}) ≅ Mon(ψ_M) up to conjugation.

## Information-Theoretic Invariants

### Mutual Information Scaling

For layers L_i, L_j with mutual information I(L_i; L_j):

```
I_{S_n(M)}(L_i; L_j) = I_M(L_i; L_j) + O(log n)
```

The logarithmic correction comes from increased capacity.

### Fisher Information Metric

The Fisher information matrix:

```
g_{ij} = E[∂_i log p(x|θ) · ∂_j log p(x|θ)]
```

defines a Riemannian metric on parameter space.

**Theorem 5**: The scalar curvature R of (M, g) satisfies:

```
R_{S_n(M)} = n^{-2/d} · R_M + O(n^{-4/d})
```

where d is the intrinsic dimension.

## Conservation Laws

### Noether's Theorem for Neural Networks

For symmetry transformation T_ε with generator X:

```
δL = ε · X[L] = 0 (invariance)
```

This implies conserved current:

```
J^μ = ∂L/∂(∂_μφ) · X[φ]
```

**Theorem 6**: Scale symmetry implies conservation of:

```
D = ∑_l l · ||W_l||_F^2 (weighted depth norm)
```

### Energy-Like Invariants

Define neural Hamiltonian:

```
H[M] = ∑_l [||∇_l||^2 + V(φ_l)]
```

**Proposition 2**: H[S_n(M)] = n^γ · H[M] where γ is the dynamical critical exponent.

## Spectral Invariants

### Eigenvalue Distribution

For weight matrix W with eigenvalues {λ_i}:

```
ρ(λ) = (1/n)∑_i δ(λ - λ_i)
```

**Theorem 7**: The moments M_k = ∫λ^k ρ(λ)dλ satisfy:

```
M_k^{(S_n)} = n^{k/2} · M_k^{(M)} (Marchenko-Pastur scaling)
```

### Spectral Gap

The gap Δ = λ_1 - λ_2 scales as:

```
Δ_{S_n} = n^{-1/ν} · Δ_M
```

where ν is the correlation length exponent.

## Practical Computation

### Algorithm: Invariant Extraction

```python
def compute_invariants(model):
    # Topological
    betti = compute_betti_numbers(model.activations)
    euler = compute_euler_characteristic(model.attention_graph)
    
    # Dynamical
    lyapunov = compute_max_lyapunov(model.dynamics)
    
    # Spectral
    gap = compute_spectral_gap(model.weights)
    
    # Information
    fisher_curvature = compute_fisher_scalar_curvature(model)
    
    return {
        'topological': (betti, euler),
        'dynamical': lyapunov,
        'spectral': gap,
        'geometric': fisher_curvature
    }
```

### Validation Protocol

1. Compute invariants on M_small (1M parameters)
2. Compute on M_large (1B parameters)
3. Test conservation:
   ```
   ε = ||I[M_large] - f(n)·I[M_small]|| / ||I[M_small]||
   ```
4. If ε < threshold, invariant is conserved

## Implications for Training

### Invariance Loss

Augment training with:

```
L_inv = λ ∑_i |I_i[M_t] - I_i^target|^2
```

This encourages interpretable structure preservation.

### Curriculum by Invariants

Train sequence M_1 → M_2 → ... → M_n maintaining:

```
I[M_{k+1}] = I[M_k] + δ_k
```

where δ_k are controlled perturbations.

## Conclusion

The mathematical framework reveals:
1. Specific invariants that must be conserved
2. Scaling laws for quasi-invariants
3. Computational methods for validation
4. Design principles for interpretable scaling

This transforms scale from obstacle to tool.
