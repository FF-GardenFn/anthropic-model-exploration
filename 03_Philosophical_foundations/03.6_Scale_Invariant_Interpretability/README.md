## Abstract

This section examines scale-invariant interpretability - the hypothesis that certain mathematical invariants computed on small models remain conserved or transform predictably in larger models. This approach addresses computational tractability challenges in mechanistic interpretability.

## Core Framework

The approach examines mathematical invariants across model scales:
1. Identify mathematical invariants in small models
2. Test invariant conservation at larger scales  
3. Utilize invariant relationships for behavioral prediction

```python
# Conservation testing
invariant_small = compute_invariant(model_1M)
invariant_large = compute_invariant(model_1B)
conservation_error = abs(invariant_small - invariant_large) / invariant_small
```

## Research Motivation

### Interpretability Applications
- **Computational Efficiency**: Analyze small models to understand larger ones
- **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipate capability emergence through invariant tracking
- **Architectural Design**: Construct models with specific invariant properties

### Model Analysis Applications  
- **Phase Transitions**: Invariant discontinuities may indicate qualitative behavioral changes
- **Property Detection**: Identify emergent capabilities through invariant analysis
- **Behavioral Prediction**: Use invariant relationships for capability forecasting

## Key Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: RG Universality
Transformers belong to specific universality classes with conserved critical exponents.

### Hypothesis 2: Topological Robustness
The "shape" of computation (Betti numbers, Euler characteristic) is scale-independent.

### Hypothesis 3: Holomorphic Conservation
Residue theorems and pole structures scale predictably.

## Empirical Status

**Current Status**: Theoretical framework requiring empirical validation

Proposed validation experiments:
- [ ] RG exponent analysis across GPT-2 model series  
- [ ] Topological invariant conservation testing
- [ ] Holomorphic residue scaling verification
- [ ] Correlation analysis with capability emergence
