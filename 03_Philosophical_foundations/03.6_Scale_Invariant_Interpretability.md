## Abstract

Scale-invariant interpretability examines mathematical invariants that remain conserved or transform predictably across neural network scales. This approach addresses computational tractability challenges in mechanistic interpretability by enabling analysis of small models to understand larger ones through conserved mathematical structures.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Core Hypothesis

The central hypothesis proposes that certain mathematical observables O[M] exhibit scale invariance:

```
O[M(n·θ)] = f(n) · O[M(θ)] + δ(n)
```

where:
- M(θ) is a model with θ parameters
- n is the scaling factor  
- f(n) is a predictable scaling function
- δ(n) represents bounded deviation terms

### 1.2 Universality Classes

Neural architectures may belong to discrete universality classes, analogous to physical systems near critical points. Within each class, specific observables remain invariant across scales through three mechanisms:

**Level 1: Exact Invariants**
- Topological invariants (Euler characteristic, Betti numbers)
- Algebraic constraints (rank relationships)
- Symmetry group structures

**Level 2: Statistical Invariants**  
- Critical exponents (β, ν, γ)
- Scaling dimensions
- Correlation length ratios

**Level 3: Asymptotic Invariants**
- Renormalized couplings at fixed points
- Universal amplitude ratios
- Anomalous dimensions

### 1.3 Mathematical Formalization

**Renormalization Group Framework**

For transformer with L layers and activation pattern A = {A₁, ..., A_L}:

$$H[A] = \sum_{l=1}^L E_{\text{self}}(A_l) + \sum_{l=1}^{L-1} J_l \cdot E_{\text{coupling}}(A_l, A_{l+1})$$

Critical points satisfy:
$$\mathcal{R}_b[H^*] = H^*$$

where $\mathcal{R}_b$ is the renormalization transformation with blocking factor b.

**Correlation Length Analysis**

For separation r between tokens:
$$G(r, l) = \langle A_l(x) \cdot A_l(x+r) \rangle - \langle A_l(x) \rangle \langle A_l(x+r) \rangle$$

Layer l is critical when:
$$\xi_l \sim |T - T_c|^{-\nu}$$ 

where T is effective temperature and ν is the critical exponent.

## 2. Candidate Invariants

### 2.1 Geometric Invariants

**Persistent Homology**: Birth/death patterns of topological features
- Betti numbers β_k counting k-dimensional holes
- Persistence diagrams tracking feature lifespans
- Euler characteristic of attention graphs

**Curvature Measures**: Manifold geometry properties
- Scalar curvature of representation manifolds
- Ricci curvature along information flows
- Sectional curvature at computational bottlenecks

### 2.2 Dynamical Invariants

**Stability Measures**: System evolution characteristics
- Lyapunov exponents indicating chaos/stability
- Correlation dimensions measuring fractal structure
- Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy quantifying information production

**Critical Behavior**: Phase transition indicators
- Order parameters for computational phases
- Susceptibility near critical points
- Finite-size scaling exponents

### 2.3 Information-Theoretic Invariants

**Mutual Information Scaling**: 
$$I_{S_n(M)}(L_i; L_j) = I_M(L_i; L_j) + O(\log n)$$

**Fisher Information Metric**:
The scalar curvature R of Fisher metric satisfies:
$$R_{S_n(M)} = n^{-2/d} \cdot R_M + O(n^{-4/d})$$

## 3. Operational Implementation

### 3.1 Self-Organizing Sparse Autoencoders (SOSAE)

Building on Modi et al. (2024), SOSAE architecture provides operational scale-invariant feature discovery:

```
Loss = (1+α)^k · h_i + |h_i|
```

The exponential position penalty (1+α)^k implements discrete RG transformation:

1. **RG Flow**: Higher-indexed features require exponentially stronger activation
2. **Fixed Points**: Surviving features represent scale-invariant observables  
3. **Universality Classes**: Early dimensions capture universal patterns, later dimensions capture scale-specific refinements

### 3.2 Algorithmic Framework

**Invariant Extraction Protocol**:
```python
def compute_scale_invariants(model):
    # Topological analysis
    betti = compute_betti_numbers(model.activations)
    euler = compute_euler_characteristic(model.attention_graph)
    
    # Dynamical analysis  
    lyapunov = compute_max_lyapunov(model.dynamics)
    correlation_length = fit_correlation_decay(model)
    
    # Information-theoretic analysis
    fisher_curvature = compute_fisher_scalar_curvature(model)
    mutual_info = compute_layer_mutual_information(model)
    
    return {
        'topological': (betti, euler),
        'dynamical': (lyapunov, correlation_length),
        'information': (fisher_curvature, mutual_info)
    }
```

**Conservation Testing**:
```python
def validate_conservation(invariants_small, invariants_large, scale_factor):
    conservation_results = {}
    
    for invariant_type in invariants_small:
        predicted = predict_scaling(invariants_small[invariant_type], scale_factor)
        observed = invariants_large[invariant_type]
        
        relative_error = abs(predicted - observed) / abs(predicted)
        conservation_results[invariant_type] = {
            'error': relative_error,
            'conserved': relative_error < threshold
        }
    
    return conservation_results
```

## 4. Empirical Predictions

### 4.1 Conservation Laws
**Prediction 1**: Critical exponents β, ν computed on GPT-2-small match GPT-2-XL within 5%
**Prediction 2**: Betti numbers scale predictably: β_k(large) = f(n) · β_k(small)
**Prediction 3**: Euler characteristic ratios remain constant across scales

### 4.2 Phase Transitions
**Prediction 4**: Capability jumps coincide with invariant discontinuities
**Prediction 5**: Training dynamics preserve critical invariants early in training
**Prediction 6**: Architecture changes affect invariants in predictable ways

### 4.3 Cross-Architecture Universality
**Prediction 7**: Models with similar invariants exhibit similar behaviors regardless of architecture
**Prediction 8**: Different training procedures converge to similar invariant values
**Prediction 9**: Fine-tuning preserves core invariants while modifying task-specific ones

## Conclusion

Scale-invariant interpretability offers a mathematical framework for addressing computational tractability in neural network analysis. By identifying conserved mathematical structures across scales, this approach enables efficient analysis of large models through small proxies. While extensive empirical validation remains necessary, the theoretical foundation and operational implementations through SOSAE architectures provide promising initial evidence for the framework's viability.

The approach transforms interpretability from post-hoc analysis to predictive science, potentially enabling the design of inherently interpretable systems through mathematical constraints rather than algorithmic fixes.
