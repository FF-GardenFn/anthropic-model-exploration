# Research Projects: Mathematical Foundations for Model Exploration

> Summary: Three research directions building on RKHS circuit analysis for welfare applications

## Overview

This directory contains three research projects that collectively advance model exploration research through mathematically rigorous approaches. All projects build on the unified theoretical framework established in [Common Foundations](../04_Math_foundations/), which connects attention mechanisms to kernel ridge regression theory and morphemic semantic analysis.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Core Mathematical Result

Building on Goulet Coulombe (2025)'s proof that attention mechanisms implement restricted forms of ordinary least squares in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), we demonstrate that:

- **Mathematical Correspondence**: `Attention(Q,K,V) ≡ K(K + λI)^(-1)V`
- **Morphemic Integration**: Semantic field analysis provides welfare-relevant feature decomposition

### Welfare Applications Framework

The mathematical foundation enables three complementary approaches to model behavior and welfare research:

1. **Circuit-Level Analysis**: Extract and route welfare-relevant computational patterns
2. **Commitment Verification**: Monitor safety properties through spectral analysis
3. **Long-Context Monitoring**: Track welfare evolution across extended interactions

## Research Projects

### [Project 1: Routed Circuit Tomography](./06.1_Routed_Circuit_Tomography/)

**Objective**: Develop mathematically rigorous circuit extraction and routing for welfare assessment

**Approach**: Replace heuristic circuit ranking (CRI ≥ 0.7) with statistical significance testing[^stat-method]

**Notes on expected effects (conditional on setup)**: selective routing with task‑tuned thresholds; see Appendix for procedures[^stat-method]

**Mathematical Foundation**: 
- RKHS projection operators for surgical intervention
- Representer theorem provides bounds on behavior
- GCV optimization for automatic parameter selection

### [Project 2: Proof-Carrying Commitments](./06.2_Proof_Carrying_Commitments/)

**Objective**: Develop mathematical verification framework for safety commitment monitoring

**Approach**: Encode commitments as constraints in RKHS spaces with spectral monitoring

**Notes on expected effects (conditional on setup)**: detection of commitment violations with task‑tuned procedures; see Appendix for interpretation[^stat-method]

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Spectral analysis of attention patterns for commitment consistency
- Hat matrix bounds for predictable intervention effects  
- Eigenvalue monitoring for systematic anomaly detection

### [Project 3: Emergent Welfare in Long-Context Agents](./06.3_Emergent_Welfare_In_Agents/)

**Objective**: Systematic welfare monitoring framework for extended context interactions

**Approach**: Combined spectral–semantic analysis integrating RKHS tools with morphemic tracking

**Notes on expected effects (conditional on setup)**: detection of welfare‑relevant changes across extended interactions; thresholds and procedures are task‑tuned and reported in the Appendix[^stat-method]

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Morphemic field analysis for semantic drift detection
- Temporal integration of spectral and compositional monitoring
- Context‑adaptive mathematical tools

## Unified Methodology

### Common Mathematical Infrastructure

All projects leverage shared mathematical components:

**Kernel Analysis Engine**:
- Eigenvalue decomposition with numerical stability guarantees
- GCV optimization for automatic regularization parameter selection
- Hat matrix computations for intervention analysis

**Morphemic Processing Framework**:
- Semantic field interpolation for continuous representation
- Pole detection for morphological feature analysis
- Compositional consistency verification

**Statistical Validation Pipeline**:
- Significance testing protocols[^stat-method]
- Cross-validation frameworks with confidence intervals
- Effect size quantification for practical significance
