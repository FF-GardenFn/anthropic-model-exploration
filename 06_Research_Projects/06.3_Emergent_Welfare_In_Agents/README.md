## Purpose

This project investigates welfare-relevant behaviors that emerge in extended context interactions through systematic mathematical monitoring and targeted intervention. The research applies optimal transport theory and RKHS spectral analysis to detect and characterize welfare degradation patterns across long conversations, complementing circuit analysis and commitment verification with temporal dynamics assessment.

## Critical Mathematical Connection: Wasserstein-RKHS Bridge Integration

This project implements the Wasserstein-RKHS Bridge (04.6) framework to analyze semantic evolution across extended contexts:

- **Optimal Transport Theory**: Uses Wasserstein distances to measure semantic drift between conversation states over time
- **Distributional Analysis**: Applies mathematical measure theory to characterize welfare-relevant distributional changes
- **Semantic Evolution Tracking**: Combines RKHS spectral analysis with optimal transport metrics for comprehensive monitoring
- **Context-Adaptive Framework**: Integrates temporal dynamics with mathematical stability analysis for long-context assessment
