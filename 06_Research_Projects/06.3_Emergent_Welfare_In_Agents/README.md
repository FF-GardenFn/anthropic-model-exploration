# Emergent Welfare in Long-Context Agents

Purpose. This project investigates welfare-relevant behaviors that emerge specifically in extended interactions and develops low‑cost, targeted interventions. It complements Project 1 (Routed Circuit Tomography) and Project 2 (Proof-Carrying Commitments) by focusing on temporal dynamics and long‑context monitoring.

Relation to anthropic research program 
- Relevance: Long-context welfare monitoring maps to evaluation priorities around stability, drift, and commitment adherence over extended interactions.
- If successful (specified setup): provides evidence for tracking welfare-relevant changes over time using spectral and semantic diagnostics.

Notes
- Where significance or guarantees are implied, references are provided to the Appendix methodology for definitions and limitations.
