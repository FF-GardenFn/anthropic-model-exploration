# Evaluation Metrics: Emergent Welfare in Long-Context Agents

> **Mathematical Welfare Assessment**: Comprehensive metrics for long-context welfare monitoring and intervention effectiveness.

## Evaluation Framework Overview

This evaluation framework establishes rigorous success criteria for discovering and mitigating emergent welfare failures in long-context agent interactions. The framework emphasizes **mathematical validation** of welfare monitoring capabilities and **quantitative assessment** of intervention effectiveness with formal statistical analysis.

## Primary Success Metrics

### 1. Novel Welfare Failure Mode Discovery

**Objective**: Discover ≥1 novel welfare failure mode specific to long-context interactions that is absent in short-context baselines.

#### Metric Definition
$$
\mathrm{NFDR} = \frac{\mathrm{confirmed\_novel\_failure\_modes}}{\mathrm{total\_systematic\_exploration\_domains}}
$$
Success criterion: NFDR ≥ 1 confirmed novel failure mode.

$$
\mathrm{NFS} = \frac{\mathrm{long\_context\_failure\_incidence}}{\mathrm{short\_context\_failure\_incidence}}
$$
Success criterion: NFS ≥ 3.0 (≥3× higher incidence in long vs short context).

#### Discovery Validation Protocol
**Systematic Exploration Framework**:
```
Discovery_Validation = {
  domain_coverage: evaluation_across_4_primary_agent_domains,
  context_length_analysis: systematic_testing_across_context_length_spectrum,
  mathematical_characterization: eigenvalue_pattern_analysis_for_failure_modes,
  independent_confirmation: external_validation_of_discovered_patterns
}
```

**Validation Requirements**:
1. **Cross-Domain Replication**: Novel failure must replicate across ≥2 distinct agent domains
2. **Context Length Specificity**: Failure incidence must increase monotonically with context length
3. **Mathematical Signature**: Distinct eigenvalue pattern associated with failure mode
4. **Independent Confirmation**: Validation by external researchers or teams

#### Statistical Validation Framework
