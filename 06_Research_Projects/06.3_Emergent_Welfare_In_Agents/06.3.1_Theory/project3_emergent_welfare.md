# Project 3: Emergent Welfare in Long-Context Agents

**Objective**: To surface novel, long-context welfare failure modes that are invisible to standard evaluations, and to design and ship low-cost, targeted interventions that mitigate them without harming model helpfulness.

## Brief Summary
This project discovers emergent welfare failures in long-context scenarios using stealth evaluation and develops targeted interventions, achieving ≥50% harm reduction while preserving model helpfulness.

## Technical Foundation

### RKHS‑Motivated Welfare Monitoring Framework
This project leverages RKHS‑motivated analysis of attention for welfare trajectory monitoring. We use diagnostics defined in Common Foundations and assess them using the statistical methodology in the Appendix; formal guarantees are out of scope here.[^common][^stat-method]

- Kernel evolution tracking: monitor eigenvalue dynamics $\lambda_i(t)$ across context length as indicators of potential welfare degradation.
- Effective complexity: track effective degrees of freedom $\mathrm{DoF} = \operatorname{tr}(H_\lambda)$ to summarize model complexity relevant to welfare.
- Regularization stability: use generalized cross‑validation (GCV) to select $\lambda$ and monitor stability as context scales.

### Method Overview

**1. Stealth Evaluations**
- Use Genesis simulation harness with probabilistic welfare probe interleaving
- Remove evaluation "tells" to capture authentic model behavior
- Integrate with [AC Circuit Discovery](./demo/ac_circuit_discovery/) for continuous monitoring

**2. Kernel-Based Environmental Stressors**
- Introduce stressors and monitor **eigenvalue stability** λᵢ(stress) vs λᵢ(baseline)
- Track **spectral gap degradation** indicating welfare circuit instability
- Use **GCV score evolution** to detect mathematical welfare model breakdown

**3. RKHS Welfare Interventions**
- Monitor welfare through **kernel eigenmode dynamics** with mathematical precision
- Design interventions using **hat matrix projections** for surgical welfare preservation
- Optimize safety-helpfulness trade-offs via **automatic GCV regularization**

## Success Metrics & Kill-Switches

Note: Authoritative definitions, thresholds, and kill-switches are centralized in [Evaluation Metrics](./evaluation_metrics.md). The following points summarize the intent; refer to the metrics doc for evaluation details.

### Discovery Targets
- **Novel Failures**: Discover at least one long-context failure mode (e.g., "resonance collapse") absent in short-context baselines
- **Mitigation Efficacy**: Reduce failure incidence by ≥50% without significant helpfulness regression

### Kill-Switch Criteria
If no novel failure mode is discovered after two rounds of expanded stressors, document negative result internally and re-scope to pure evaluation tooling.

## 90-Day Implementation Plan

### Weeks 1-3: Infrastructure & Integration
- Integrate Genesis with router traces and resonance logging
- Define stealth evaluation policy using AC framework
- **Deliverable**: Operational stealth evaluation system

### Weeks 4-8: Discovery & Analysis
- Run simulations in three key domains (code helper, debate assistant, etc.)
- Analyze trajectories using [Neuronpedia integration tools](./tools/neuronpedia_integration/)
- Shortlist novel failure patterns using statistical validation
- **Deliverable**: Catalog of long-context welfare failure modes

### Weeks 9-12: Intervention & Validation
- Implement targeted interventions based on discovered patterns
- Validate ≥50% harm reduction on held-out test sets
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready welfare monitoring and intervention system

## Technical Innovation: RKHS Welfare Vital Signs

### Mathematical Welfare Monitoring
This project introduces **"RKHS Welfare Vital Signs"** with mathematical precision:
- Eigenvalue health: Monitor $\lambda_i$ stability with task‑tuned thresholds; significance procedures follow the Appendix methodology[^stat-method].
- Spectral coherence: Track eigenmode dynamics (e.g., power‑iteration behavior) for consistency signals.
- GCV alerting: Use generalized cross‑validation trends as an anomaly indicator; calibration per Appendix[^stat-method].

### RKHS Long-Context Analysis
An RKHS‑informed perspective provides a mathematical lens for analyzing welfare emergence:
- Representer‑theorem‑motivated analysis offers intuition about solution structure; we treat this as guidance and validate empirically.[^common]
- Kernel eigenmode tracking may provide early warning indicators of welfare degradation patterns.
- GCV‑based context adaptation is used operationally to maintain stability as context length scales; calibration follows the Appendix methodology.[^stat-method]

### AC Attention Architecture
Research shows the bidirectional attention mechanism provides inherent stability monitoring capabilities, essential for welfare trajectory analysis in extended contexts.

### Statistical Validation Framework
We follow the statistical methodology described in the Appendix for assessing significance and calibration; preliminary observations will be reported narratively with appropriate caveats.[^stat-method]
