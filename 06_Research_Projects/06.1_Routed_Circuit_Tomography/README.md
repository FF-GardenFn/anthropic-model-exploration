## Purpose

This project develops mathematically rigorous circuit extraction and routing methods that enable targeted welfare analysis and support experimental protocols. The framework provides principled approaches to identifying computationally relevant attention layers and circuits.

## Critical Experimental Connection: AVAT Layer Selection

This circuit tomography framework directly enables the AVAT (Attention Visualization and Analysis Tasks) experimental protocols by providing mathematical methods for identifying layers 15-20 as computationally significant. The circuit extraction process:

- **Layer Identification**: Uses eigenvalue analysis and spectral gap assessment to systematically identify attention layers with high computational relevance
- **Mathematical Validation**: Replaces heuristic layer selection with statistical significance testing and RKHS-based stability analysis  
- **Experimental Support**: Provides principled foundation for AVAT attention visualization tasks requiring focused layer analysis
