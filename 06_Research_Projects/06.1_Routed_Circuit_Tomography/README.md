Relation to anthropic research program 
- Relevance: Circuit tomography provides evidence for selecting and routing heads/mechanisms implicated in welfare‑relevant behavior.
- If successful (specified setup): enables targeted analysis and reduced activation cost on tasks aligned with the job description’s evaluation focus.


Scope & limitations
- Results are reported under specified datasets/models/configurations; interpret per Appendix methodology.
- Claims are framed as evidence under specified conditions; no publication or deployment claims are made here.
