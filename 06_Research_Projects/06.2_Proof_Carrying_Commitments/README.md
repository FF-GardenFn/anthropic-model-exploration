## Purpose

This project develops a mathematical verification framework for safety commitment monitoring through RKHS-based spectral analysis and categorical verification methods. The approach combines kernel ridge regression theory with categorical semantics to provide formal guarantees for commitment adherence.

## Critical Mathematical Connection: AHOS Framework Integration

This project directly extends the AHOS Framework (04.5) categorical verification approach by applying fibration-based behavioral conformances to commitment monitoring:

- **Categorical Verification**: Uses fibrations F: **Safe** â†’ **Commit** to formalize commitment verification through categorical semantics
- **Compositional Guarantees**: Employs pullback constructions to ensure local commitment proofs compose to global safety properties  
- **Behavioral Conformances**: Applies higher-order congruences to map nested safety properties through categorical pullbacks
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Bridges categorial proof theory with RKHS constraint verification for formal commitment attestation
