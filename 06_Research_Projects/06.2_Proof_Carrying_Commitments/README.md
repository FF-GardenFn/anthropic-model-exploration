Purpose. This project develops an RKHS-motivated framework for attesting safety-related commitments via spectral and operator diagnostics.

Contents
- Proposal: ./proposal.md
- Theory & Methodology: 06.2.1_Theory/methodology.md
- Evaluation Metrics: 06.2.1_Theory/evaluation_metrics.md
- Current Implementation (if present): 06.2.2_Current_Implementation/

Methodological references
- Common mathematical definitions (RKHS operators, diagnostics): ../../04_Math_foundations/04.1_RKHS_Mathematical_Foundations.md
- Statistical procedures, null models, calibration and caveats: ../../08_Appendix/08.5_methodology_statistical_significance.md

Relation to anthropic research program 
- Relevance: Commitment attestation instruments map to evaluation priorities in the job description (e.g., detecting and tracking violations under specified setups).
- If successful (specified setup): provides attestable evidence of commitment adherence using spectral/operator signals.


Scope & limitations
- Evidence is reported under specified datasets/models/configurations and interpreted per Appendix methodology.
- Results are research evidence under stated conditions.
- Where significance or guarantees are implied, references are provided to the Appendix methodology for definitions and limitations.
