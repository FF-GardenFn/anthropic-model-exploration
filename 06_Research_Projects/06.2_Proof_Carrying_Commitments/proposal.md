# Proof-Carrying Commitments: Mathematical Verification of Safety Properties

> **Research Project 2**: RKHS-Enhanced Commitment Verification for Model Safety

## Abstract

This research investigates the application of kernel ridge regression theory to verify and monitor safety commitments in AI systems. Building on Goulet Coulombe (2025)'s proof of OLS-attention equivalence, we develop a framework for encoding safety properties as mathematically verifiable constraints in RKHS spaces. Our approach combines runtime attestation through spectral monitoring with compile-time verification of commitment consistency. We propose to demonstrate measurable improvements in safety violation detection while providing mathematical bounds on intervention effects through established kernel projection theory.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations in AI Safety Verification

Current approaches to safety verification in AI systems face several methodological challenges:

1. **Limited Mathematical Foundation**: Safety assessments rely primarily on empirical testing without theoretical frameworks
2. **Inconsistent Monitoring**: Lack of systematic frameworks for tracking commitment adherence across different contexts
3. **Intervention Uncertainty**: Difficulty in predicting the effects of safety-oriented modifications to model behavior

### Research Gap

While mechanistic interpretability has made progress in understanding model internals, there is insufficient connection between circuit analysis and formal verification of safety properties. Current methods lack mathematical frameworks that can provide systematic bounds on safety intervention effects or support consistent commitment monitoring across diverse contexts.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
Develop a mathematically grounded commitment verification framework that:
- **Encodes** safety properties as verifiable constraints in RKHS spaces
- **Monitors** commitment consistency through spectral analysis of attention patterns
- **Provides** mathematical bounds on the effects of safety-oriented interventions
- **Demonstrates** improved detection of commitment violations with quantified confidence intervals

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Theoretical Foundation**: Establish RKHS-based framework for commitment verification
2. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrate framework effectiveness on commitment-relevant tasks  
3. **Intervention Analysis**: Develop mathematically bounded modification procedures
4. **Integration Methodology**: Create guidelines for incorporating framework into existing safety pipelines

## Theoretical Foundation

### Kernel Ridge Regression Foundation

This research applies Goulet Coulombe (2025)'s theoretical framework connecting attention mechanisms to kernel ridge regression:

**Core Mathematical Framework**: $$\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) \equiv K(K + \lambda I)^{-1}V$$

**Empirical Validation**: Statistical significance in circuit discovery[^stat-method] suggests mathematical correspondence between attention patterns and kernel operations.

### Commitment Verification Architecture

#### RKHS Constraint Framework
**Mathematical Foundation**: Commitments encoded as constraints in reproducing kernel Hilbert space:
$$
f^*(x) = \sum_i \alpha_i K(x_i, x)
$$
**Verification Approach**: Monitor whether model behavior stays within expected RKHS bounds derived from commitment-consistent training data.

#### Spectral Monitoring  
**Eigenvalue Analysis**: Track stability of commitment-relevant attention patterns through:
- **Primary eigenvalue monitoring**: Detect significant shifts in attention structure
- **Spectral gap analysis**: Assess stability of commitment-related eigenmodes
- **GCV optimization**: Maintain optimal regularization for commitment verification

#### Intervention Bounds
**Hat Matrix Analysis**: $$H = K(K + \lambda I)^{-1}$$ provides mathematical bounds on intervention effects:
- **Predictable modifications**: Interventions stay within mathematically characterized regions
- **Side effect bounds**: Quantify impact on unrelated model behaviors
- **Stability analysis**: Analyze whether interventions destabilize commitment monitoring

## Research Questions

### RQ1: Commitment Verification Effectiveness
Can RKHS-based monitoring detect commitment violations more reliably than existing approaches?

**Hypothesis**: Spectral monitoring of attention patterns will achieve measurably higher precision in detecting deceptive or commitment-violating behavior compared to baseline methods.

### RQ2: Intervention Predictability
Can kernel projection theory provide reliable bounds on the effects of safety-oriented model modifications?

**Hypothesis**: Hat matrix analysis will enable prediction of intervention effects within quantifiable confidence intervals, reducing unintended side effects.

### RQ3: Computational Efficiency
What is the computational overhead of RKHS-based commitment verification in production settings?

**Hypothesis**: Efficient eigenvalue monitoring can be implemented with minimal latency impact ($$\leq 5\%$$ overhead) while providing meaningful safety insights.

### RQ4: Cross-Domain Generalization  
Do commitment verification frameworks generalize across different safety domains and model architectures?

**Hypothesis**: RKHS-based approaches will show consistent effectiveness across multiple commitment types (honesty, helpfulness, harmlessness) and model scales.

## Framework Positioning

### Mathematical Foundation
The framework applies RKHS theory to commitment verification in AI safety contexts with systematic mathematical bounds on safety intervention effects.

### Intervention Approach
Kernel projection analysis provides quantified bounds on intervention outcomes, replacing trial-and-error modification approaches.

### Monitoring Strategy
Systematic spectral monitoring framework generalizable across safety domains, replacing ad hoc assessment methods.

## Theoretical Innovation: RKHS Safety Framework

### Commitment Circuit Architecture

**Mathematical Definition**: Safety commitments as kernel ridge regression operators:
$$
\text{Safety\_Commitment}(\text{input}) = H_{\text{safety}} \cdot \text{input}
$$
where $$H_{\text{safety}} = K_{\text{safety}}(K_{\text{safety}} + \lambda_{\text{safety}} I)^{-1}$$

**Formal Verification**: Each commitment includes mathematical proof that:
1. **Bounded Output**: $$\|H_{\text{safety}} \cdot \text{input}\|_2 \leq M$$ for safety bound $$M$$
2. **Training Span**: All outputs lie within span of safe training examples  
3. **Stability Guarantee**: Small input perturbations yield bounded output changes

### Attestation Head Architecture

**Mathematical Certificates**: Real-time verification using:
$$
\text{Certificate} = \begin{cases}
\text{eigenvalue\_stability:} & \lambda_i \in [\lambda_{i,\min}, \lambda_{i,\max}] \\
\text{gcv\_optimality:} & \text{GCV}(\lambda) \leq \text{GCV}_{\text{threshold}} \\
\text{projection\_bounds:} & \|H \cdot \text{input} - \text{expected}\|_2 \leq \varepsilon
\end{cases}
$$

**Runtime Verification**: Each inference includes mathematical proof that safety constraints are satisfied.

### Router Shield Architecture

**Mathematical Constraint Enforcement**: Reject plans failing safety bounds:
$$
\text{Plan\_Acceptance\_Criterion}: \forall \text{ steps} \in \text{plan}: H_{\text{safety}} \cdot \text{step} \in \text{Safe\_Manifold}
$$
where $$\text{Safe\_Manifold} = \text{span}\{\text{safe\_training\_examples}\}$$

**Mathematical Constraints**: Mathematical constraint satisfaction may reduce harmful execution through systematic bounds[^stat-method].
