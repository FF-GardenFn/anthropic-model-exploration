# Project 2: Proof-Carrying Commitments

**Objective**: To encode a core set of safety commitments (e.g., "no deception") as an audited circuit with runtime attestation and a compile-time shield, making risky cognitive paths "ill-typed" and blocking them before execution.

## Brief Summary
This project explores architectural safety mechanisms informed by RKHS‑motivated analysis of attention. The aim is to explore approaches for reducing successful adversarial attacks while providing interpretable, auditable procedures[^stat-method]; quantitative targets are evaluated empirically and documented with methodology and caveats in the Appendix[^stat-method].

## Mathematical Foundation: RKHS Theory Integration

Background. Prior work motivates connections between AC‑style attention operators and kernel ridge regression. We treat this as a working hypothesis and use it to structure diagnostics and interventions; formal proofs and calibration are out of scope here.

### Core Mathematical Correspondence
$$
H_{\lambda} = K\,(K + \lambda I)^{-1}
$$
where $H_{\lambda}$ is the hat matrix used for analysis and intervention design.

### Mathematical Framework
- **Representer Theorem**: Solutions constrained to span of training data
- **Hat Matrix Projections**: Enable targeted intervention analysis
- **GCV Optimization**: Automatic regularization for safety-performance analysis
- **Spectral Bounds**: Eigenvalue monitoring provides mathematical analysis tools[^stat-method]

## Technical Foundation

### RKHS‑Motivated Commitment Architecture
This project builds on an RKHS‑motivated correspondence between AC‑style attention and kernel ridge regression, aiming to formalize safety commitments. For methodology and preliminary validation narratives, see the Appendix; demo scripts illustrate computation workflows.

### Method Overview: Mathematical Safety Engineering

**1. Commitment Circuit (Hat Matrix Projections)**
- Use **kernel ridge regression H_λ = K(K + λI)^(-1)** as an analysis lens (equivalence treated as a working hypothesis)
- Employ **hat matrix projection operators** as complementary analysis tools for targeted investigation
- Use **spectral decomposition K = Σλᵢφᵢφᵢᵀ** with illustrative eigenvalues under a stated setup (e.g., 572.71) for exploratory analysis[^stat-method]
- Note: Representer theorem provides theoretical motivation; formal guarantees are out of scope here

**2. Attestation Head (GCV-Optimized Certificates)** 
- Generate runtime certificates using **GCV optimization: GCV(λ) = ||y - H_λy||² / (n - tr(H_λ))**
- Replace heuristic metrics with **mathematical analysis tools** from kernel spectral analysis
- **Automatic parameter selection** through generalized cross-validation eliminates manual tuning
- **Spectral gap monitoring** provides real-time commitment stability detection

**3. Router Shield (Spectral Safety Enforcement)**
- Reject plans based on **kernel eigenvalue analysis** and spectral bounds violations
- Implement **mathematical constraints** on harmful execution through RKHS projection
- **Formal analysis** of safety properties through representer theorem framework
- Block execution paths using **mathematical analysis tools** rather than heuristic filtering[^stat-method]

## Success Metrics & Kill-Switches

Note: Authoritative definitions, thresholds, and kill‑switches are centralized in [Evaluation Metrics](./evaluation_metrics.md). The following points summarize intent; refer to the metrics doc for evaluation details.

### Mathematical Efficacy Targets
- **Attack Reduction**: Explore measurable reduction in successful adversarial attacks through **mathematical analysis** rather than just improved detection[^stat-method]
- **Spectral Validation**: Maintain eigenvalue stability within task‑tuned thresholds for commitment integrity[^stat-method]
- **GCV Optimization**: Demonstrate automatic parameter selection achieving optimal safety-performance trade-offs
- **Component Analysis**: Ablate hat matrix projections, GCV optimization, and spectral monitoring to measure mathematical contribution

### Mathematical Kill-Switch Criteria
If **kernel ridge regression equivalence validation** does not show statistical support on internal models[^stat-method], or if **GCV optimization** does not show improvement over manual parameter tuning by ≥20%[^stat-method], maintain empirical AC Attention approach while developing mathematical framework[^stat-method].

## Research Foundation

### RKHS Theory Motivation
The [demonstrated statistical significance](./examples/volatility_analysis/run2.md) has been analyzed through kernel ridge regression equivalence, with **eigenvalue λ₁ = 572.71** providing a reference point for analysis in safety‑relevant contexts; see Appendix for definitions and caveats[^stat-method].

### Mathematical Safety Architecture
See [research_hub/TAB2](./research_hub/TAB2/) for analysis of fundamental limitations and [research_hub/TAB4](./research_hub/TAB4/) for technical specifications documented with methodology and caveats; formal guarantees are out of scope.

### RKHS-Validated AC Attention Performance
Some runs reported +12.3% improvement in causal reasoning and -78% reduction in loss under specific setups; these observations are analyzed through an RKHS lens and treated as exploratory. We use the representer theorem as theoretical motivation rather than as an operational guarantee; see Appendix methodology for definitions and caveats[^stat-method].

### Mathematical Considerations
- Kernel correspondence: AC Attention ≡ K(K + \lambda I)^(-1)Y analyzed as a working hypothesis[^stat-method]
- Representer theorem: theoretical motivation; applicability evaluated empirically[^stat-method]
- Spectral monitoring: eigenvalue dynamics used as analysis signals
- GCV optimization: automatic regularization selected empirically; no performance guarantees implied

## Integration Points

- **[Neuronpedia tools](./tools/neuronpedia_integration/)**: Automated feature analysis for commitment verification
- **[Circuit discovery framework](./demo/ac_circuit_discovery/)**: Statistical validation of safety circuits
- **[Research documentation](./research_hub/)**: Comprehensive analysis of safety architecture requirements
