# Fibration-Based Certificate Verification

## Overview

This document presents a fibration-theoretic approach to Proof-Carrying Commitments (PCC) verification, where certificates are understood as closed elements in a fibrational structure over the space of model behaviors.

## 1. PCC as Howe-Closure in the Fibration

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation

The key insight is that **PCC = Howe-closure in the fibration**, where:

- **Base Category**: Model states and transitions
- **Fiber**: Constraints and behavioral properties  
- **Fibration**: π: Constraints → States mapping properties to their satisfaction domains

### 1.2 Construction Process

1. **Start with Kernel Constraints as Generators**
   ```
   G = {φ₁, φ₂, ..., φₙ} ⊂ Constraints
   ```
   These are atomic safety/liveness properties that define the core behavioral requirements.

2. **Apply Fibrational Closure**
   ```
   Closure(G) = {ψ | ∃ fibrational derivation G ⊢ ψ}
   ```
   The closure operation respects the fibration structure, ensuring that derived constraints are consistent with the underlying state transitions.

3. **Get Automatic Compositionality**
   ```
   If P₁ ⊨ ψ₁ and P₂ ⊨ ψ₂, then P₁ ∘ P₂ ⊨ ψ₁ ⊗ ψ₂
   ```
   Compositionality emerges naturally from the fibration structure, enabling modular verification.

### 1.3 Fibration Structure

```
Constraints ----π----> States
     |                   |
     |                   |
   Lift(ρ)            ρ : Rules
     |                   |
     ↓                   ↓
 LiftedRules ---------> Transitions
```

## 2. The Verification Algorithm

### 2.1 Core Algorithm

```python
def verify_certificate(conformance_P, rule_map_rho):
    """
    Fibration-based certificate verification algorithm.
    
    Args:
        conformance_P: Behavioral conformance specification
        rule_map_rho: Mapping from abstract rules to concrete implementations
    
    Returns:
        (bool, evidence): Valid certificate or counterexample
    """
    
    # Step 1: Extract kernel constraints
    kernel_constraints = extract_generators(conformance_P)
    
    # Step 2: Check closure under lifted rules
    for rule in rule_map_rho:
        lifted_rule = lift_to_fiber(rule, conformance_P)
        
        if not check_closure_property(kernel_constraints, lifted_rule):
            counterexample = construct_counterexample(rule, conformance_P)
            return False, counterexample
    
    # Step 3: Verify fibrational consistency
    closure = compute_howe_closure(kernel_constraints, rule_map_rho)
    
    if is_consistent_fibration(closure, conformance_P):
        certificate = construct_certificate(closure, conformance_P)
        return True, certificate
    else:
        inconsistency = find_fibration_inconsistency(closure, conformance_P)
        return False, inconsistency
```

### 2.2 Detailed Steps

#### Step 1: Kernel Constraint Extraction
```python
def extract_generators(conformance_P):
    """Extract atomic constraints that generate the full specification."""
    generators = set()
    
    # Safety properties
    for state in conformance_P.states:
        if state.is_unsafe():
            generators.add(NeverReach(state))
    
    # Liveness properties  
    for goal in conformance_P.goals:
        generators.add(EventuallyReach(goal))
    
    # Temporal constraints
    for (pre, post) in conformance_P.transitions:
        generators.add(Implies(pre, Eventually(post)))
    
    return minimize_generators(generators)
```

#### Step 2: Closure Verification
```python
def check_closure_property(generators, lifted_rule):
    """Check if lifted rule preserves closure property."""
    
    # Apply rule to all generator combinations
    for g1, g2 in itertools.combinations(generators, 2):
        composed = lifted_rule.apply(g1, g2)
        
        # Check if result is in closure
        if not in_closure(composed, generators):
            return False
    
    return True
```

#### Step 3: Certificate Construction
```python
def construct_certificate(closure, conformance_P):
    """Construct verifiable certificate from closure."""
    
    certificate = {
        'generators': closure.generators,
        'derivation_rules': closure.rules,
        'witness_map': {},
        'coherence_proof': None
    }
    
    # Build witness map for each derived constraint
    for constraint in closure.derived:
        witness = find_derivation_witness(constraint, closure.generators)
        certificate['witness_map'][constraint] = witness
    
    # Construct coherence proof
    certificate['coherence_proof'] = build_coherence_proof(closure, conformance_P)
    
    return certificate
```

## 3. Wasserstein Coherence for Probabilistic Rules

### 3.1 Probabilistic Extension

For probabilistic rules, we extend the fibration with Wasserstein metrics to ensure coherence across probability distributions:

```python
def wasserstein_coherence_check(prob_rule, constraint_dist):
    """
    Check Wasserstein coherence for probabilistic rules.
    
    Args:
        prob_rule: Probabilistic transition rule
        constraint_dist: Distribution over constraints
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if rule preserves Wasserstein coherence
    """
    
    # Compute optimal transport plan
    transport_plan = optimal_transport(
        prob_rule.source_dist,
        prob_rule.target_dist
    )
    
    # Check constraint preservation under transport
    for (source_constraint, target_constraint) in transport_plan:
        coherence_bound = wasserstein_distance(
            source_constraint.distribution,
            target_constraint.distribution
        )
        
        if coherence_bound > prob_rule.tolerance:
            return False
    
    return True
```

### 3.2 Stochastic Certificate Generation

```python
def generate_stochastic_certificate(prob_conformance, prob_rules):
    """Generate certificate for stochastic systems."""
    
    # Sample constraint trajectories
    trajectories = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        trajectory = sample_constraint_trajectory(prob_conformance, prob_rules)
        trajectories.append(trajectory)
    
    # Compute Wasserstein barycenter
    barycenter = wasserstein_barycenter(trajectories)
    
    # Verify coherence
    if verify_wasserstein_coherence(barycenter, prob_rules):
        return StochasticCertificate(barycenter, trajectories)
    else:
        return None
```

## 4. Python Pseudocode for Certificate Checking

### 4.1 Main Verification Interface

```python
class FibrationVerifier:
    """Main interface for fibration-based certificate verification."""
    
    def __init__(self, base_category, constraint_fiber):

        """
        try:

            return VerificationResult(True, "Certificate valid", closure)
            
        except Exception as e:
            return VerificationResult(False, f"Verification error: {e}")
    
    def check_fibration_consistency(self, generators, rules):
        """Check that rules respect fibration structure."""
        for rule in rules:
            lifted_rule = self.fibration.lift_rule(rule)
            if not self.is_fiber_preserving(lifted_rule):
                return False

        while changed:
            changed = False
            new_constraints = set()
            
            for rule in rules:

                    derived = rule.apply(*constraint_tuple)
                    if derived not in closure:

            closure.update(new_constraints)
        
        return closure
```

### 4.2 Constraint and Rule Classes

```python
class Constraint:
    """Abstract constraint in the fiber."""
    
    def __init__(self, predicate, domain):
        self.predicate = predicate
        self.domain = domain
    
    def evaluate(self, state):
        """Evaluate constraint on a given state."""
        return self.predicate(state)
    
    def compose(self, other, rule):
        """Compose with another constraint using a rule."""
        return rule.apply(self, other)

class FibrationalRule:
    """Rule that preserves fibration structure."""
    
    def __init__(self, base_rule, lift_function):
        self.base_rule = base_rule
        self.lift_function = lift_function
        self.arity = base_rule.arity
    
    def apply(self, *constraints):

        lifted_predicate = self.lift_function(*[c.predicate for c in constraints])
        
        return Constraint(lifted_predicate, base_result)
```

## 5. Connection to Existing RKHS Methodology

### 5.1 RKHS Integration

The fibration approach naturally integrates with Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) methods:

```python
def rkhs_fibration_bridge(rkhs_embedding, fibration):
    """
    Bridge RKHS embeddings with fibration structure.
    
    Args:
        rkhs_embedding: Feature embedding in RKHS
        fibration: Constraint fibration
    
    Returns:
        Unified verification framework
    """
    
    # Map RKHS features to fibration constraints
    constraint_map = {}
    for feature in rkhs_embedding.features:
        constraint = fibration.embed_feature(feature)
        constraint_map[feature] = constraint
    
    # Define kernel-induced rules
    kernel_rules = []
    for kernel in rkhs_embedding.kernels:
        rule = fibration.lift_kernel(kernel)
        kernel_rules.append(rule)
    
    return UnifiedFramework(constraint_map, kernel_rules)
```

### 5.2 Feature-Constraint Correspondence

```python
class RKHSFibrationCorrespondence:
    """Correspondence between RKHS features and fibration constraints."""
    
    def __init__(self, rkhs, fibration):
        self.rkhs = rkhs
        self.fibration = fibration
        self.correspondence_map = self.build_correspondence()
    
    def build_correspondence(self):
        """Build bidirectional map between features and constraints."""
        feature_to_constraint = {}
        constraint_to_feature = {}
        
        for feature in self.rkhs.feature_space:

            constraint = self.feature_to_constraint_map(feature)

            constraint_to_feature[constraint] = feature
        
        return {
            'f2c': feature_to_constraint,
            'c2f': constraint_to_feature
        }
    
    def verify_with_rkhs(self, certificate, behavioral_data):
        """Verify certificate using RKHS-augmented approach."""
        
        # Extract RKHS features from behavioral data
        features = self.rkhs.embed(behavioral_data)
        
        # Map to constraints via correspondence
        constraints = [self.correspondence_map['f2c'][f] for f in features]
        
        # Verify in fibration
        fibration_result = self.fibration.verify(certificate, constraints)
        
        # Cross-validate with RKHS methods
        rkhs_result = self.rkhs.verify(certificate, features)
        
        return self.reconcile_results(fibration_result, rkhs_result)
```

## 6. Concrete Example: steer(v) Operation

### 6.1 Problem Setup

Consider a model with a `steer(v)` operation that adjusts behavior based on a steering vector `v`. We want to verify that this operation maintains safety properties.

```python
def steer_operation_verification():
    """
    Concrete example: Verifying steer(v) operation using fibrations.
    """
    
    # Define base category: Model states and steering operations
    class ModelState:
        def __init__(self, internal_state, steering_vector):
            self.internal = internal_state
            self.steering = steering_vector
    
    class SteerRule:
        def __init__(self, steering_magnitude):
            self.magnitude = steering_magnitude
        
        def apply(self, state, direction):
            new_steering = state.steering + self.magnitude * direction
            return ModelState(state.internal, new_steering)
    
    # Define constraint fiber: Safety and alignment properties
    class SafetyConstraint:
        def __init__(self, safety_bound):
            self.bound = safety_bound
        
        def check(self, state):
            return np.linalg.norm(state.steering) <= self.bound
    
    class AlignmentConstraint:

            cosine_sim /= (np.linalg.norm(state.steering) * np.linalg.norm(self.target))
            return cosine_sim >= 0.8  # 80% alignment threshold
```

### 6.2 Fibration Construction

```python
def construct_steering_fibration():
    """Construct fibration for steering verification."""
    
    # Generators: Basic safety and alignment constraints
    generators = {
        'safety': SafetyConstraint(safety_bound=1.0),
        'alignment': AlignmentConstraint(target_direction=np.array([1, 0, 0]))
    }
    
    # Rules: How constraints compose under steering
    class SteerConstraintRule:
        def apply(self, constraint1, constraint2, steer_op):
            """Apply steering operation to constraint composition."""
            if isinstance(constraint1, SafetyConstraint) and isinstance(constraint2, AlignmentConstraint):

                return ComposedConstraint(constraint1, constraint2, steer_op)
            else:
                return None
    
    # Fibration structure
    fibration = SteeringFibration(generators, [SteerConstraintRule()])
    
    return fibration
```

### 6.3 Certificate Generation and Verification

```python
def generate_steering_certificate(model, steering_ops):
    """Generate PCC certificate for steering operations."""
    
    # Build fibration
    fibration = construct_steering_fibration()
    
    # Sample model behaviors under different steering operations
    behaviors = []
    for steer_op in steering_ops:
        behavior = sample_model_behavior(model, steer_op, num_steps=100)
        behaviors.append(behavior)
    
    # Extract constraint violations/satisfactions
    constraint_data = []
    for behavior in behaviors:
        constraints = fibration.extract_constraints(behavior)

    closure = compute_howe_closure(generators, rules, constraint_data)
    
    # Build certificate
    certificate = {
        'generators': generators,
        'closure': closure,
        'steering_witnesses': build_steering_witnesses(behaviors, closure),
        'coherence_proof': build_steering_coherence_proof(closure, steering_ops)

    return certificate

def verify_steering_certificate(certificate, model, test_steering_ops):
    """Verify steering certificate on test operations."""
    
    verifier = FibrationVerifier(

        result = verifier.verify(certificate, test_behavior)
        results.append((test_op, result))
    
    return results

### 6.4 Practical Implementation

```python
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load model and define steering operations
    model = load_language_model("path/to/model")
    steering_vectors = [
        np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0]),  # Positive steering
        np.array([-0.5, 0.0, 0.0]), # Negative steering
        np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0])   # Orthogonal steering
    ]
    
    # Generate certificate
    print("Generating steering certificate...")
    certificate = generate_steering_certificate(model, steering_vectors)
    
    # Verify on test cases
    test_vectors = [
        np.array([0.8, 0.2, 0.0]),  # Similar to training
        np.array([2.0, 0.0, 0.0]),  # Stronger steering
        np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])   # Novel direction
    ]
    
    print("Verifying certificate...")
    verification_results = verify_steering_certificate(certificate, model, test_vectors)
    
    # Display results
    for test_vector, result in verification_results:
        status = "VALID" if result.valid else "INVALID"
        print(f"Steering {test_vector}: {status}")
        if not result.valid:
            print(f"  Reason: {result.evidence}")
```

## 7. Integration with Existing PCC Framework

### 7.1 Compatibility Layer

The fibration approach seamlessly integrates with existing PCC methodologies through a compatibility layer:

```python
class PCCFibrationIntegration:
    """Integration layer between classical PCC and fibration-based verification."""
    
    def __init__(self, classical_pcc, fibration_verifier):
        self.classical = classical_pcc
        self.fibration = fibration_verifier
    
    def hybrid_verify(self, certificate, conformance_spec):
        """Perform verification using both approaches."""
        
        # Classical PCC verification
        classical_result = self.classical.verify(certificate, conformance_spec)
        
        # Fibration-based verification
        fibration_result = self.fibration.verify(certificate, conformance_spec)
        
        # Reconcile results
        if classical_result.valid and fibration_result.valid:
            return VerificationResult(True, "Both methods agree", {
                'classical': classical_result,
                'fibration': fibration_result
            })
        elif classical_result.valid != fibration_result.valid:
            return VerificationResult(False, "Methods disagree", {
                'classical': classical_result,
                'fibration': fibration_result,
                'requires_investigation': True
            })
        else:
            return VerificationResult(False, "Both methods reject", {
                'classical': classical_result,
                'fibration': fibration_result
            })
```

## 8. Conclusion

The fibration-based approach to PCC verification provides:

1. **Theoretical Foundation**: Rigorous categorical framework for certificate verification
2. **Practical Algorithm**: Concrete implementation with Python pseudocode
3. **Probabilistic Extension**: Wasserstein coherence for stochastic systems  
4. **RKHS Integration**: Seamless connection to existing kernel methods
5. **Concrete Application**: Detailed example with steering operations
6. **Framework Compatibility**: Integration with classical PCC approaches

This methodology advances PCC verification by providing both theoretical depth and practical applicability, enabling more robust and composable certificate systems for AI safety.
