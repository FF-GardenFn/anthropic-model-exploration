# Unicorn Analysis

AC Circuit Discovery analysis for fictional narrative detection.

## Test Input
*"In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley in the Andes Mountains."*

## Files
- `run1.md`: Execution log with circuit discovery pipeline
- `analysis_results.txt`: 138 discovered features with Neuronpedia descriptions
- `*.json`: Raw attention pattern data

## Key Results

**Top Circuits**:
1. Layer 11, Head 3: 572.71 concentration (7.7σ significance)
2. Layer 11, Head 2: 569.69 concentration (7.6σ significance)
3. Layer 15, Head 4: 535.24 concentration (7.0σ significance)

**Statistical Validation**:
- Baseline: 123.95 ± 58.60
- p < 10^-14 for top discoveries
> Statistical validation was made on a small smaple size for demonstration purposes. Research will be performed on substantially larger datasets. Results may vary. ( most defnitely)

Analysis integrated into main demo notebook (`09_Demo/`).
