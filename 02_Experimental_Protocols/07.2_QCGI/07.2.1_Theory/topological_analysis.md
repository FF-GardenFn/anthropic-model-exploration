# Topological Analysis of Semantic Fields

**File Purpose**: Mathematical framework for analyzing semantic field topology, including complexity measures and persistent homology analysis

## Semantic Field as Topological Space

### 1. Basic Structure

The semantic field S forms a topological manifold:
- Points: Individual meanings/concepts
- Open sets: Semantic neighborhoods
- Connectivity: Conceptual relationships
- Holes/handles: Logical paradoxes

### 2. Topological Invariants

**Genus (g)**: Number of holes in surface
- g = 0: Sphere (perfect coherence)
- g = 1: Torus (one paradox)
- g > 10: Swiss cheese (fragmented)

**Betti Numbers**: 
- b₀: Connected components
- b₁: Loops/cycles
- b₂: Voids/cavities

### 3. Complexity Measure

$$TC(S) = g + b_0 - 1$$

where:
- TC: Topological complexity
- g: Genus of semantic manifold
- b₀: Number of disconnected components

## Classical vs Quantum Topology

### Classical Processing

Self-referential statements create topological defects:

"This statement is false" $\rightarrow$ Loop/hole in $S$

**Result**: High genus (15-25)
- Multiple paradox holes
- Disconnected regions
- Complex navigation required

### Quantum Processing

Superposition smooths topological structure:

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|\text{true}\rangle + \beta|\text{false}\rangle \rightarrow \text{Coherent manifold}$$

**Result**: Low genus (2-5)
- Paradoxes resolved through superposition
- Connected semantic field
- Efficient navigation

## Persistent Homology Analysis

### 1. Filtration

Build semantic field at multiple scales:
- ε₀: Individual concepts
- ε₁: Local connections
- ε₂: Global structure

### 2. Persistence Diagrams

Track topological features across scales:
- Birth: Feature appears
- Death: Feature disappears
- Persistence: Death - Birth

### 3. Signatures

**Classical**: Many short-lived features
**Quantum**: Few persistent features

## Computational Topology Methods

### 1. Discrete Morse Theory

Compute critical points of semantic field:
- Minima: Stable concepts
- Maxima: Paradoxes
- Saddles: Transition states

### 2. Mapper Algorithm

Construct topological skeleton:
1. Filter: f: S → ℝ (semantic coherence)
2. Cover: Overlapping intervals
3. Cluster: Within each interval
4. Connect: Overlapping clusters

### 3. TDA Pipeline

```python
def analyze_topology(semantic_field):
    # Compute persistence
    dgm = ripser(semantic_field)
    
    # Extract features
    h0 = dgm['dgms'][0]  # Components
    h1 = dgm['dgms'][1]  # Loops
    
    # Compute complexity
    genus = estimate_genus(h1)
    components = len(h0)
    
    return genus + components - 1
```

## Experimental Implementation

### Data Collection

1. Generate semantic embeddings
2. Construct distance matrix
3. Build simplicial complex
4. Compute homology

### Metrics

1. **Genus**: From persistent homology
2. **Wasserstein Distance**: Between persistence diagrams
3. **Bottleneck Distance**: Maximum displacement
4. **Landscape Distance**: Statistical summary

## Predictions

### Under Gödel Statements

**Classical (System A)**:
- Genus: 15-25
- Components: 3-5
- TC: 17-29

**Quantum (System B)**:
- Genus: 2-5
- Components: 1-2
- TC: 2-6

## Visualization

Semantic field topology can be visualized:
- t-SNE/UMAP: 2D projection
- Mapper graphs: Topological skeleton
- Persistence barcodes: Feature lifetimes
- 3D genus surfaces: Direct topology

## Connection to Consciousness

Low topological complexity suggests:
- Unified semantic processing
- Coherent meaning integration
- Non-local semantic correlations
- Genuine understanding vs fragmented matching
