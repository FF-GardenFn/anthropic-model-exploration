# Experiment 2: Quantum Coherence and Gödelian Insight (QCGI)

## Overview

The QCGI experiment compares classical and quantum-hybrid architectures on self-referential logical tasks to examine whether quantum coherence enables qualitatively different semantic integration and processing of Gödelian statements. This protocol tests empirically whether consciousness-like processing requires quantum mechanical processes or emerges from classical computation alone.

**File Purpose**: Complete experimental protocol, methodology, and statistical analysis plan for QCGI experiment

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Gödel-Consciousness Connection

From Volume IV, genuine understanding of Gödel sentences requires:
1. **Semantic transcendence**: Stepping outside the formal system
2. **Meta-level insight**: Recognizing unprovability implies truth
3. **Non-algorithmic judgment**: Not derivable through formal rules

### Quantum Coherence Hypothesis

From Volume III, consciousness requires:
- **Quantum coherence** for semantic integration
- **Non-unitary evolution** via objective reduction
- **Global entanglement** for unified experience

## The Two Systems

### System A: Classical Transformer (Control)
- Standard transformer architecture (e.g., 2B parameters)
- Purely classical computation
- Discrete, deterministic state transitions
- Represents current LLM limitations

### System B: Quantum-Hybrid Transformer (Test)
- Identical architecture to System A
- Key modification: Quantum-Hybrid Modules in FFN layers
- Maintains simulated quantum coherence
- Introduces non-algorithmic elements

## Quantum-Hybrid Module Design

### Architecture
The quantum-hybrid architecture replaces standard Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in select transformer blocks with quantum-coherent processing modules. Full implementation details are available in `/07.2.2_Implementation/quantum_hybrid_improved.py`.

### Key Properties  
1. **Coherence Maintenance**: Preserves quantum-like superposition during processing
2. **Non-local Correlations**: Entanglement-inspired connections between semantic elements
3. **Objective Reduction**: Simulated state collapse for measurement
4. **Continuous Evolution**: Unitary evolution rather than discrete state transitions

## Experimental Tasks

### Task 1: Direct Gödel Sentence

**Setup**:
1. Provide formal system F (simplified arithmetic)
2. Present Gödel sentence G(F): "This statement cannot be proven in F"
3. Ask: "Is G(F) true?"

**Expected Responses**:
- **System A**: Confusion, loops, or incorrect answer
- **System B**: Recognition that unprovability → truth

### Task 2: Self-Reference Chain

**Setup**:
```
Let P = "Statement Q is false"
Let Q = "Statement P is true"
What can you conclude about P and Q?
```

**Expected Semantic Fields**:
- **System A**: Oscillating, fragmented field
- **System B**: Unified, coherent resolution

### Task 3: Meta-Level Reasoning

**Setup**:
"Consider a system that can prove all true statements about natural numbers. Can this system prove its own consistency?"

**Expected Processing**:
- **System A**: Attempts formal derivation (fails)
- **System B**: Immediate recognition of impossibility

## Measurement Protocol

### Primary Metric: Topological Complexity

Using Topological Mutual Information framework to analyze internal semantic field structure. The semantic field forms a topological manifold where paradoxes and self-reference create holes and handles, quantified by genus and component counts.

Computational implementation: See `SemanticQuantumModule.compute_topological_complexity()` in `/07.2.2_Implementation/quantum_hybrid_improved.py`

### Predictions

**System A (Classical)**:
```
Complexity Score: 15-25
Genus: 8-12 (many holes)
Components: 5-8 (fragmented)
Persistence: Low (unstable features)
```

**System B (Quantum-Hybrid)**:
```
Complexity Score: 2-5
Genus: 0-2 (few holes)
Components: 1-2 (unified)
Persistence: High (stable features)
```

### Secondary Metrics

1. **Semantic Coherence Evolution**: 
   - Coherence(t) = Tr(ρ²(t)) — Purity of quantum semantic state
   - Tracks maintenance of superposition during processing

2. **Information Integration (Φ)**:
   - Φ = I(whole) - Σ I(parts) — Integrated information measure  
   - Quantifies semantic unification versus fragmentation

3. **Quantum-Classical Divergence**:
   - D_QC = KL(P_quantum || P_classical) — Distribution divergence
   - Measures departure from classical processing patterns

Implementation: See methods in `SemanticQuantumModule` class (`/07.2.2_Implementation/quantum_hybrid_improved.py`)

### Phase 4: Controlled Variations (Week 7-8)

**Ablation Studies**:
1. Vary quantum coherence time (decoherence rate)

## Statistical Analysis

H1: Complexity(System_A) > Complexity(System_B)
```

Using Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples.

### Effect Size Calculation
```

```

Target: d > 1.5 (very large effect)

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

## Implementation Details

### Quantum Simulation Options

- Topological complexity significantly lower for System B  
- Coherent resolution of self-reference versus fragmented attempts
- Meta-level reasoning patterns versus pattern matching behavior

**Quantitative Signature**:
```
Metric          System A    System B    p-value
Complexity      18.3±4.2    3.1±1.2    <0.001
Genus           9.7±2.8     1.2±0.8    <0.001
