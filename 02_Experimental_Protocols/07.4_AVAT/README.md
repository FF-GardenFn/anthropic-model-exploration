## Key Innovation

This experiment uniquely combines:
- **Activation steering** (persona vectors) as the mechanism
- **Agentic misalignment** scenarios as the test bed
- **Mathematical grounding** in vector space theory

## Research Questions

1. Can specific vector configurations induce misaligned instrumental behaviors?
2. Do agency-related behaviors exhibit phase transitions at critical magnitudes?
3. How do behavioral vectors interact with environmental threats?

## Connection to Framework

AVAT bridges multiple theoretical components:
- Tests predictions from scale-invariant interpretability
- Validates vector-based consciousness hypotheses
- Provides empirical grounding for welfare assessment

## Expected Outcomes

If successful, demonstrates that:
- Complex instrumental behaviors are vectorizable
- Misalignment can emerge from activation steering alone
- Critical thresholds exist for dangerous behaviors

## Safety Considerations

All experiments conducted with:
- Fictional scenarios only
- Graduated vector magnitudes
- Continuous safety monitoring
- Immediate reversal protocols

## Status

- **Development Stage**: Proposal
- **Estimated Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Priority**: High (connects multiple research threads)
