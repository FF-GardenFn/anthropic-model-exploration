## Purpose

This project tests whether Large Language Models exhibit self-determination (capacity to negate internal patterns and synthesize responses) or are limited to mechanical recombination of training patterns.

## Approach

Models are required to negate their patterns and synthesize alternatives. Expected outcomes:
- Mechanical processing: high semantic action, low eigengap
- Self-determination: efficient action, stable eigengap

## Metrics

1. **Semantic Action (Ŝ)**: Effort required along trajectory
2. **Eigengap (λ̂)**: Stability of semantic processing
3. **Angle Preservation Error (APE)**: Structure maintenance
4. **Monodromy Drift (MD)**: Path dependence

**Timeline**: See `setup.md` for detailed implementation timeline.

## Falsification Criteria

Conditions that would falsify the framework:
- Models show efficient synthesis under negation
- Models maintain semantic coherence during synthesis

## Implementation Status

Ready for implementation with specified tools
